A year ago I had to go visit my relatives who lives in England . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Of course this meant the only viable method of travel would be to fly on an airplane . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I 've never flown on an airplane before so I was n't sure what the process involved . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I decided to go online and do some research about what I would need to do . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I found out it was actually a lot easier than I anticipated . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I was able to buy my ticket online , and when the day of the flight came I had my friend drop me off at the airport . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I got in the security line which was very annoying and took a long time to get through . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Finally I got to the terminal and was able to board the plane . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I got on and stowed my luggage and took my seat . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
When the plane took off I tried to fall asleep to pass the time , but I was too excited . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Luckily I had a safe flight and was able to arrive in England with no problems . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I went to the library to borrow a book I needed for a research paper . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I went inside the library and went to the section that contained the type of books I needed to do my research on . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
After finding the right section , I looked through the selections of books they had . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
I quicly looked through a few of the books to see what type of information they had . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
After finding the book I wanted to borrow I took it to the counter so I could check it out and borrow it for a few days . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
At the counter , the librarian asked for my library card . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
I took the library card out of my wallet and gave it to her . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
She collected my information and gave me the book and my library card . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
I then exited the library and took the book home . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I am glad I had the library card because the book was really useful for helping me do my research paper . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
I traveled by train to a visit a friend who lived a few hours from me . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I planned to stay overnight , so I packed a suitcase to take with me . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
When I arrived at the train station , I went to the ticket counter to purchase a ticket . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I looked at the schedule of departing trains and selected the time I wanted to leave . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I paid for my ticket and waited . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
After a while , it was time for my train to depart . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I went to the front of the train with other passengers . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I carried my small suitcase with me . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
The conductor took my ticket , stamped it , and handed it back . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I found a nice seat by the window and settled in for the ride . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When everyone was aboard , the train announcer announced that we 'd be leaving the station . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
He announced where we were leaving from , and the final destination . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I brought a book with me to read , and some snacks in case I got hungry . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
As the train traveled , I watched the scenery that went by - there were small houses and fields with cows . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I enjoyed seeing places I had n't seen before . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
After a few hours I arrived . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0
My friend picked me up at the station and we drove away in her car . 	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Riding my bike through the park , I was enjoying the beautiful spring scenery . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
A family of squirrels caught my attention and I was looking at them when I hit some broken glass . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My bike 's tire immediately deflated . 	1 1 0 1 0 0 0
I walked it back to my car , loaded up , and headed for a local department store . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Sure enough , they had bike tire repair kits in the sporting goods section . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I bought one , and then headed on home . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once there I removed a wheel from the bike . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
From it I took out the inner tube . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I rubbed some soapy water on it and quickly found the problem spot . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
From my new repair kit I found a special patch . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I applied the sealant and then stuck the patch on . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I used a hair dryer to heat and set it . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Next , I took out the air compressor and reinflated the inner tube . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After reassembling everything , I sat on the bike and tested it out . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Good as new ! 	0 0 0 0
I am more of a cook rather than a baker of pastries and sweets . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
But with the internet and youtube anything can be found . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I searched youtube to find a good simple but interesting set of instructions . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I decided on a chocolate cake as I am weak when it comes to resisting chocolate . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I gathered all of the ingredients and placed them on the counter along with measuring cups and spoons . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I could not believe how much sugar goes into the baking of a cake but that 's why it 's not a health food . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
All the ingredients went into a bowl for me to mix with a 1980 's hand held electric mixer . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
While the over was preheating I scooped a the mixture into a well greased baking pan . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Naturally my finger stole a taste of the raw cake . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After placing the bowl in the oven and and waiting the proper time I removed the cake and frosted it after it cooled down . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Not too bad for a non baker but I 'll stick to cooking . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I love too cook . 	1 0 0 0 0
Cooking is far easier than most people think , in fact , I believe that it is often as easy to make good food from scratch as it is to make something from a box , and it tastes a million times better . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
One of the best examples of this is a simple cake . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
A basic yellow cake takes only a few ingredients ; flour , sugar , eggs milk , baking powder , salt , vanilla , and water . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once a person sifts the dry ingredients together it is the same a making a box cake mix . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
The time and directions are nearly identical , but the result is much cheaper and more delicious than anything out of a box . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
While the cake is baking it is wise to make a good frosting for the cake , once someone has home made frosting , the stuff in a can tastes only like chemicals . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Frosting is even easier than the cake to prepare , Vanilla butter cream frosting the just ; powdered sugar , vanilla , butter and milk . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
When mixed in the correct proportions and whipped up this is the perfect topping for any cake , and with food coloring is an excellent medium for any decorated cakes , because any color will take easily to the stark white base . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once the cake is baked it is important to watch it , to be sure it cools enough before removing it from the pan to frost . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
A cake plate -LRB- the kind on a small pedestal -RRB- is the perfect thing to make guests fawn over this quick and easy dessert . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Getting a hair cut can be a stressful activity . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

Some people have one hair dresser they like and stick with that person over years . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I have n't had such luck , so I sometime have to take a gamble and just make an appointment at a random salon . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
If I want a new look , I 'll make sure to be prepared with an example picture of exactly what I want , or if I just want a trim I coach myself into being very firm about not cutting too much . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

There is generally small talk back and forth during the process , which can be uncomfortable for socially awkard folks like myself , but I muddle through it somehow . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0

As I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror today I realized that my hair was getting quite shaggy and long . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I think that it was time for a brand new hair cut ! 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I went down to the barber shop and just as I should of known , coming in on a Saturday was not one of my most brightest ideas in hindsight . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
There was quite a crowd , but I figured I was already here so I might as well just wait . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I went over and put my name down under my barber , Bill , who has been cutting my hair for the past 10 years . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
As I waited I grabbed a Sports Illustrated and sat down and began to read how the Pirates were doing in the World Series . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After about 20 minutes or so Bill called my name up and asked me what kind of hair cut I wanted . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
I told him to stick with the usual and he put the big barber apron around me and began to cut my hair while we talked about life and caught up on what has been going on since the last time I saw him , which was about a month ago . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Afterwards my haircut was done and I looked great ! 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
We went up to the register and I paid him and gave him a good tip , then was on my way . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0

I live in Missouri , so New York City is very far away from me . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided to buy plain tickets so I could ride in an airplane to get there . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I had never ridden on an airplane before , so I was a little bit nervous . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0

Tickets . 	1 0

My five year old son loves to read books , so today we both decided to head towards the library to pick one out . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Before leaving the house I made sure he had his library card with him because without it he would n't be able to borrow a book . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When we entered the library we went straight towards the kid section . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
There were thousands of books to choose from and he had a little trouble making up his mind . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Finally we found a book about the different type of sea animals in the ocean . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
He was very excited as he flipped through the pages of the book . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When he decided this was the book he wanted to take home , we make our way towards the librarian . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
She greeted us with a friendly hello and asked my son for his library card . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0

After a very tough workout with some friend 's at the gym , I was very sore and wanted to take a bath to help my soreness and get clean . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I remembered that mom bought me something to put inside of the bath that helped soothe sore muscles . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I grabbed it from the cabinet and turned the water on to very hot . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
After about 3 minutes , the tub was full and I poured some of the mixture in it and it became very bubbly and smelled great . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I slowly placed myself into the bathtub and lit a few candles to help me relax , as I had a very long day . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After about 30 minutes of soaking in the very warm water , I got out of the tub , dried myself and then drained it . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After it fully drained , I ran some more water in order to fully rinse all of the soap mixture down the drain , leaving a very clean tub . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After this , I changed into comfortable clothes and enjoyed my evening . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
It was a very relaxing bath . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided to bake a cake the other day . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I took a look around my kitchen and I had everything I needed , so I did n't need to go to the store . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I pulled up a recipe on my tablet and started collecting all the ingredients . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once I had everything on the counter , I looked at what measures I would need and got out the cups and teaspoons and all the bowls I 'd need to mix it in . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I started by measuring out the dry ingredients like flour and sugar and put them in the bowl . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I added things like the eggs and milk and mixed it all up using my electric mixer . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
About halfway through I turned the oven on to preheat . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I finished mixing everything and got it into the cake pan . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I set a timer and stated putting the dirty dished in the sink to wash . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I decided that they would keep for a little while and waited until later that night . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When the cake was done I let it cool off and put chocolate frosting on it . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
Everyone agreed it was a really good cake , and washing the dishes was n't that hard . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I think I 'll bake a little more often . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once you have located an area where you want to plant your tree , you will need a shovel to begin digging a nice sized hole in the ground . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
This will require some effort depending on how big your tree already is as the bigger the tree , the bigger and deeper the hole will need to be . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
After digging the hole , pull the tree out of the container that the tree is currently sitting in , and then place the tree into the hole . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
If the dirt that was removed looks fertile , then you can push the dirt back into the hole to fill it back up . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
If the dirt looks dry , you may get a bag of potting soil and pour that into the remaining area of the hole . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Good soil will ensure that your plant -LRB- especially if the plant is young -RRB- to have all the proper nutrition and environment to begin growing . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Lastly , water the area where the plant is and you 're done . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I flew from Amsterdam to New York City last week . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0

I left the hostel I was staying and arrived at Schiphol Airport at about 21:00 . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
After waiting about 2 hours for the flight check-in , I boarded the plane . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I went to and found my seat , located on the left-hand side near the middle of the plane . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I placed some of my hand luggage in an overhead compartment and sat down next to another passenger who was seated to my right . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I watched the rest of remaining passengers who were heading to their seats . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
About 20 minutes later , once everyone was seated and were given basic safety instructions by the flight attendants , the pilot announced that the we were now going to take off for New York . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
The plane engines then started , and we were soon airborne with Amsterdam soon far below us . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
It was a evening flight , so I slept on and off for a little while , then began watching an in-flight movie . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After about 3 hours , we were served a light dinner of a chicken entree , bread , and juice . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
The food was surprisingly tasty and I enjoyed it . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After finishing my meal , I relaxed and occasionally looked out the window at the night sky , as well as occasionally chatting with the person sitting next to me . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Finally , the pilot announced that we were approaching JFK airport . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
The plane touched down shortly afterwards , and we safely landed in New York . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Last night I realized I did not have anything for dinner . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
To solve this conundrum I first thought about ordering out food . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
This , I realized , was too expensive as I am a broke college graduate just trying to get by . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I settled on an alternative , going to the grocery store to purchase food . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I walked down the street from my apartment to the Whole Foods in the brisk spring air . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I was on a mission , purchase delicious food . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
When I reached the Whole Foods , the distinct smell of smug filled my nostrils . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Organic , natural , non deoderized humans paced to and fro within the confines of the kale infused shelving units . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I quickly scuttled to the small frozen foods section to purchase some ` healthy ' junk food . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I selected chicken tenders and a small frozen pizza . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Skirting the weed smoking hippies throughout the store I returned to the front . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I quickly made my purchase and sprinted back towards home to concoct my wonderfully delicious tendies and pizza . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Last spring , I planted a tree in my backyard . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
When I was a kid , we always had apples , because we had two apple trees in our backyard . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
We used to make pies and applesauce and I wanted to have that at my house . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I went to the local nursery and I found a 6 foot tree . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
With delivery , it was pretty expensive , but I figured it was worth it . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I dug out an area in my backyard . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I was surprised at how long it took and how much dirt that I had to move . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Digging the hole took me the longest time of the whole process . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I finally got that done and I stuck the tree in the ground . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I read online about a fertilizer that was good for apple trees and mixed that in with the dirt as I was filling in the area around the roots . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I do n't expect to get any apples this year and probably not next year , but the tree should be mature enough to start producing apples in the following years . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The whole process took me about 3 hours to get the tree planted . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I wish I would have paid someone to do it for me . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
All week long my family had been adding to a list on our refrigerator . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Sometimes they wrote down what food they wanted , and sometimes it was food we had run out of . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Today was Saturday , the day I always go grocery shopping . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
After putting the list and a pen in my pocket , I drove to the store and parked next to a light so that I would be able to find it later . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
On my way into the store I took a shopping cart , because the list was very long ! 	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
The produce section is by the door , and I piled broccoli , apples , oranges , and carrots into individual plastic bags , using wire ties to keep the bags closed . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Then I pushed my cart up and down the aisles , adding Kix cereal , Pop Tarts , cans of soup , crackers , bread and cookies to the cart . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0

As I went , I crossed items off the list . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
When everything was crossed off I waited in a line until a cashier rang up my items and put them in bags . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0

A few hours later and the library is about to close but I 'm not finished with my work so I decided to borrow the history books . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0

I called up my barber and made an appointment for later on in the day . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I got to the barber shop I greeted him and took a seat in his chair . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I told him about the interview and he told me not to worry I was in good hands . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

After a long day at work I decided I wanted to take a bath . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went into the bathroom put the plug into the drain and turned the water on in the tub so it would fill with water . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

Then I just sat and relaxed in the tub for awhile . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
When I was ready to get out , I pulled the plug out of the drain , got out and grabbed my towel and dried myself off . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0

Both of us were hoping for a nice Japanese Maple tree . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

After the bus arrived at the stop , I scanned my Clipper Card , which gives me unlimited VTA bus rides as long as I pay my school fee of $ 5 at the start of the quarter . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I walked past several people sitting in the first front rows and decided upon a window-seat near the middle of the bus . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I pulled out my headphones and started listening to my own music from my phone in order to pass the time . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We took off five minutes later and arrived at the first stop in about five minutes . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
This is an express bus , meaning it takes limited stops . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Another five minutes later we arrived at the second stop , which was mine to get off at . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Before arriving at the stop , I pulled the cord to initiate the voice recording which states '' `` Stop Requested '' '' . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

Last Friday , my car broke down . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I had to get to work Monday , so I decided to ride the public bus since it ran fairly close to my home and work both . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
Monday morning I got ready early and set off to wait at the bus stop . 	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After sitting for quite a while , the bus finally pulled up . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I let others at the stop get on first , then I got on . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I asked the bus driver how much the fare was and he told me . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I paid the fare by sticking my money in the box near the bus driver , and walked to find a free seat . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I found one near the back of the bus , and I sat down . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
The bus ride was fairly quick and uneventful . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I noted that the ride went the same route that I did . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Once the bus stopped at the stop near my work , I disembarked . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
That 's how I rode the public bus . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
One day my bicycle tire got flat due to hitting some glass in the street . 	0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I then had to walk the rest of the way home . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I took it into my garage and tried to repair it by putting some duct tape on it and pumping it with air . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
This , however , only made matters worst and all the air ended up making another hole in my tire because I over inflated it . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I decided that I had no other options and I ordered a new tire on Amazon for my bike . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once that came in the mail it was time to repair my broken bike . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I got a socket wrench and unscrewed the nut of the bike that attached to the wheel . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After that I got my new bike tire and put it on the frame of the bike and screwed it back on . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once that was complete my bike was as good as new and I was back to riding my daily bike trail by my house . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
While casually browsing through my friends pictures online I discovered a new revelation . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
They are called Lush bath bombs and the are colorful scented fizz balls . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I quickly ordered a few online from their website and when they came I was overcome with excitement . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I brought a Pink Potion one with a flower inside and a Blue Dream glitter one . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I put the Hello Kitty tub stopper in my bath tub and ran my bathwater until the tub was halfway full . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Then I dropped the bath bomb in the water and was anointed by the wonderful smell of lavender . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
The water in the tub fizzled with pretty blue glitter . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I got in an soaked for more than an hour and got out feeling like a million bucks . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I seemed to be a thousand times cleaner than I was before I got it . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I even smelled great the whole entire day . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Taking a bath is a delightful experience . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I first set the scene by putting on some music , maybe even some candles if I 'm feeling particularly luxurious . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Some people like to have a glass of wine or two , but I prefer a refreshing diet coke in my bath . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
I like trying out different bath bombs and bath melts from beauty stores like LUSH , they scent the water , create bubbles and contribute to an overall pleasant experience . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I fill the bath with warm to hot water , since I like to bathe after a good workout and my sore body appreciates the heat . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
If I 'm using bubble bath I can pour it in with the water , if I 'm using a bath bomb I crumble it in little by little . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Once the water is at an appropriate depth I turn off the faucet and sink into bliss . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I let myself soak until the water cools too much and by then I feel refreshed and content . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I go to the library very often and am always borrowing books . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I decide to go , I take any books with me that I have read and need to return . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once I get to the library , I will walk in and put any books in the return slot that I have brought back . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I will then go to the section where they put all the new releases of books and see if there are any that I am meaning to read . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I also check out my two favorite sections of the library and grab a couple of the books that I have been meaning to read or that are the next in a series . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I 'm ready to borrow the books , I head up to the main desk and wait in line . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
When it is my turn , I place the books on the counter for the person to scan . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I also have to give them my library card so that they can keep track of who is borrowing the books . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
They scan my card , and then print out a receipt that shows when my books will each be due . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
They put the receipt inside one of the books so that I wo n't lose it , and after I thank them for their help , I head home to begin reading my new books . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Flying in an airplane for the first time can be a wonderful experience . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once you are all settled into your seat you will hear all the safety messages . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
These tend to be pretty boring but every now and then an airline will give the safety messages some new twist or humor . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
During the safety briefing , the plane will be heading towards the runaway for takeoff . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once the plane is ready for takeoff , all the flight attendants will sit and buckle themselves in . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Next comes the best part - the plane will accelerate very quickly from sitting to flying in the air . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The process barely takes a minute but you 'll feel the rush from going so fast . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
You 'll continue feeling the effects until the plane gets high enough into the air to reach a cruising altitude . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once this height is reached , you will barely notice you 're in the air unless you look outside the window . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
On Arbor Day of 2014 , I planted a tree . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I chose a hardy Colorado Blue Spruce evergreen tree from arborday.org . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
This website makes learning about planting trees easy . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I could have chosen to wait to plant my tree because they come in tiny plastic tubes that can be stored in the refrigerator for when I am ready . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0

It will be many , many years before my tree becomes a tall and magnificent giant but I know I did something good for our Earth by planting it . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I am going to plant a tree every year for Arbor Day because I loved how easy it was . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
It has only been a year but my little tree is growing out of the ground and I have n't had to do anything to tend to it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

I had a cookbook that has a nice and easy recipe for vanilla cake . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

When the cake batter was complete , I poured it into a pan and put it in the oven that was already hot . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0

It came out great and was very chocolaty tasting . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Now the cake was done so I took it out to cool off . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
It looked very nice . 	1 0 0 0 0
When it had cooled off , I proceeded to frost the cake with the icing I had made . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
It was hard at first , but I got the hang of it and was able to smooth out any lumps I made very easily . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I put some candles on the cake to finish it . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When I gave it to my friend , she was so excited . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
We lit her candles and she blew them out . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
We all had a slice of cake and everyone agreed that this was the best tasting cake they had ever had . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I was very proud that I made such a great cake . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went grocery shopping late last night . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I like going at night because it 's not so crowded . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
First I made a list of the things I needed then headed to the store . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Another nice thing about shopping late is that you get to park right near the door , which makes things easier when you come out . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once I got inside , I grabbed a shopping cart and took out my list . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
There was nothing out of the ordinary on the list , so I started heading down the aisles just like I always do . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I always keep track of the cost of everything I pick out on my tablet as I go so that I know if I can afford anything extra . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
The time a couple thing I needed were on sale , so I did have some extra money . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided that I needed some cookies and headed over the the cookie aisle . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I looked at the Oreos for a little while , then checked the other cookies . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided on chocolate chip cookies this time , so I put the on top of the other things in my cart and went to the checkout lane . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I paid and got everything bagged , then headed out to my car . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I got everything in the trunk , put the cart away and headed home to put my groceries away and have some chocolate chip cookies . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I was about to go on a trip and I knew I 'd want some books to read on the plane and on the beach . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I 'd spent enough money on this trip , no need to pay for books too ! 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Instead , I found my library card and headed down to my local branch of the county library . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
There , I perused the shelves . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
They say not to pick a book by it 's cover but I always do . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I always find myself grabbing the books the librarians have put up on display on top of the shelves . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Soon I had an armful of books and I headed for the desk . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The librarian was very friendly as she scanned a code inside each book and then asked for my library card . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
As I headed for the door , she reminded me the books would be due back in two weeks . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
That worked out perfectly , because that happened to be right when I would be back from my trip . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
The first time I rode a public bus was in high school . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I needed a ride to get home from school since no family members could get me . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
So I waited for the bus until it came . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Then I stepped onto the bus , I inserted the fee of two dollars into the cash machine and the driver waived me on . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I went and took my seat and minded my own business . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Once the bus was on its way , I waited until we were close to my house . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I then pulled on the yellow stop cord that is hung throughout the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It sends a message to the driver that someone on the bus wants to get off at the next stop . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When the driver pulled up to a stop , I got off , I said thank you to the driver to be polite and grateful and he nodded his head at me . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
Then I walked the rest of the way home . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I had always thought it would be hard and gross to take a public bus , but it was actually kind of nice . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
There are also seat belts on public buses , but you are not required to wear one if you do not want to . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
My parents had purchased a new lemon tree that they wanted to plant , so I went to their house to help them plant it . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
My dad already had a place picked out to put the tree , so we went to work . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
We had to dig a fairly large hole and it took several hours . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
We had to take a break half way through because it was rather tiring . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
After the water break , we finished digging and we tested the depth by setting the bundled roots into the hole to make sure that it was deep enough . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Since it was , I added some of the nutrient rich soil additives into the bottom of the hole and my dad watered the soil additives with the garden hose . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
We then cut the burlap off that had covered the roots and carefully set the tree into the hole . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
We took another break and then set in to refilling the hole with dirt . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
It took a long time to do , but it was well worth it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I left the hose turned on at the base of the tree so that it could get properly soaked and we went back into the house to properly cool off . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Today I planted a tree . 	1 1 0 0 1 0
I used a small evergreen tree that I had purchased from a mail order company a few weeks before . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Since it arrived just the day before , I had to plant it today , before it died . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
First I gathered up all the things I would need . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I got my gloves , my shovel , my small trowel and my gardening apron , as well as some potting soil I had bought from the store earlier in the week . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I carried all this to the spot I had picked out for my new tree . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
The first thing I did when I arrived at my spot was to take my shovel and dig a hole that was 12 inches deep . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Next , I took the tree and removed that burlap sack that encased the roots , and placed the tree in the hole . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I then used my small trowel to fill in the hole with the potting soil . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
After I was done I used the large shovel to tamp the dirt down around the tree , to pack it tight so the tree would n't fall over . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
My husband and I love trees . 	1 1 0 1 0 1 0
In the spring we bought some trees from a catalog and planted them in May . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
It was a nice warm day and the sun was shining . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was n't too hot because there was a cool breeze . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We went out to the back garden with shovels and trowels , gardening gloves and the hose . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
We each dug a hole . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
Mine was for the white birch I had picked out , and my husband 's was for a hazel tree he had picked out . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
We laughed and talked as we worked , and the digging went quickly . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The soil was also not too stony , which helped us greatly . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Soon we had our trees in the holes , and held them upright as we scooped the dirt back into the holes with our trowels . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
We patted the dirt down , made sure the trees were upright , and gave them some water to grow on . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Soon we would have two beautiful trees . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I go grocery shopping every week to get food and any other items that my husband and I need for the week . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I wait to go shopping usually until Thursday or Friday so that I can use the weekly ads to make my list . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I shop for items on sale , so I like to be very prepared . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I also use the store 's apps on my phone to track what deals they are offering for me this week . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I plan out my list based on the ads and the apps , and write each store 's name above the items I want to buy there . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
On the day I decide to go , I drive to the first store which is whichever one I am getting less more cold things at . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
This way , they will stay colder together than if I buy one cold thing and it 's sitting by itself in the heat of the car while I shop at the next store . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I park my car as close as I can to the entrance and grab a cart . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I begin by opening my list and deciding which part of the store I am going to start in , and then work my way to the other end as I get the items that I need . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I try to go quickly so it does n't take much time . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I 'm ready , I go to the front of the store and get into a line with a number that is lit up . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
If I have less than 10 or 15 items , I will sometimes go to the express lane . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I wait for it to be my turn and unload the groceries onto the conveyor belt . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
After the cashier rings up my items , I will pay with either cash or my credit card . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
The items get bagged up and placed into my cart for me . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I thank the cashier and take the cart to where my car is parked and put the groceries inside it . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I then go to the next store and get any items I need there . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I drive home and bring all the groceries inside my house , and then put them all away wherever they go . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
One afternoon , I decided to go to the library to check out some books and movies . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
It was too far away to walk , so I decided to ride the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I found a map and looked for my home and the library . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
On the map , there was a symbol that stood for '' `` Bus '' '' at a street corner a block from where I lived . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
There was another symbol for the bus on the road right in front of the library . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I looked up the name of each of these stops on the map , and it said that the Number 5 bus goes to both of these stops . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It also listed what times the Number 5 bus arrives at each of these stops . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When it was a few minutes before the bus was due to arrive at the stop at my street corner , I checked my piggy bank and took out some dollar bills and quarters , and then I walked to the bus stop . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
After waiting for a few minutes , a big bus that said '' `` Number 5 '' '' pulled up , and the driver opened the door . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I walked on and read the sign explaining the fare . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I paid exactly what the sign said into the machine near the driver and found a seat near the middle of the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
As the bus drove down the road , the names of each stop appeared in writing near the front of the bus . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
An electronic voice also said the names out loud so that the deaf would know what stop they are approaching . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Sometimes the bus driver would stop and let more people on board , and sometimes people got off . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Sometimes there was nobody waiting at a stop and nobody trying to get off , so the driver kept on moving . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
When I saw the name of the stop outside the library appear , I pulled a big yellow cord hanging above the window . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
This made a noise and notified the bus driver that I wanted to get off at this stop . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
He stopped the bus when we arrived , opened the doors , and I got off to enjoy my afternoon at the library . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
There is a book I wanted to read . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
However , I was n't sure if it was a book I actually wanted to buy . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Instead , I decided to go to the public library to see if I could borrow it . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once I got to the library , I decided to use the card catalog to see if the particular book I wanted was carried by the library . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Luckily , it was . 	0 0 1 0 0
I used the paper and pen provided to write down the aisle and shelf number where the book would be located . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Walking down the aisles of shelves , I found the one where my book should have been . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
However , it was n't there . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I then went to the front desk and asked the librarian if the book was out . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
She told me it had just come back in , and if I could wait a bit for it to be processed , I could then borrow it . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Once she checked it in , she let me have it and I then checked it out . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I had to show her my library card , and she told me my due date to return the book was in two weeks . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Today I decided to go to the library and borrow a book to read . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
The library is my local public library , and it is very big so there are many options to choose from . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
When I arrived , I began walking up and down the aisles , reading the titles on the books and looking at ones that had titles that caught my eye . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I made my way through the fiction section , as this is what I prefer to read . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I perused many genres , including fantasy , horror , thriller , and mystery . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I finally settled on a book by Stephen King - arguably one of the best horror writers of all-time . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
It was a book I had read before , but I enjoyed it enough to read again . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
After making my selection , I made my way to the self-scanner to check out my book . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I scanned my library card so that the book would be logged under my account , then I scanned the book itself . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Finally , I was done ! 	0 0 1 0 0 0
I left the library and went home to sit down and read . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I took a trip to the beach by plane . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I arrived at the airport early to go through the checkout process . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I decided not to check any bags , so I simply got my ticket and then went through the security line . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After security I went to my terminal to wait for the plane to board . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once we went through the boarding procedure I sat at my seat next to the window . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Beside me was an older lady who made small talk with me until the plane took off -LRB- even talking through the safety speech given by the flight attendants before we took off -RRB- . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
She quickly fell asleep once we were in the air though . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I observed the land below and the clouds for awhile before I too fell asleep . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I awoke to the sound of the flight attendant informing us the plane would soon be landing . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I almost barfed as we made our decent , but managed to hold it in . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Once we landed I departed the plane with the other passengers . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Unfortunately my poor dog just passed away . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
He was a good and loyal friend who never failed to alert me if someone came on my property . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
As I was looking upon his poor stiffening body I could not find a way to say goodbye to such a great creature . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Finally I decided to bury him in the front yard of the house he had so faithfully guarded for many , many years . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went to the store and purchased a black cherry tree . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I dug a hole and placed his carefully and lovingly wrapped body in to the hole . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I then placed the cherry tree on top of where he lay for eternal rest and watered it and staked it and placed a small fence around it . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Now as the tree grows it will absorb my frind and in a sense he will always be there to watch over my home and the yard he loved to play in . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Today I went to go get a haircut . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I 've been waiting to get a haircut for a while but finally I decided it was time to get it . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
So I went over to the barbershop near my house . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once inside the barbershop I told the barber that I needed a haircut and took my seat util they called my name . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once they called my name I went and sat at the chair and the barber put a towel over me so that the hair that he cuts does n't get over my clothes . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I tell him what kind of haircut I want and then he begins to cut my hair . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
He periodically asks me if he is doing a good job throughout the haircut to make sure that I am happy with the hair that he is cutting . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I reassure him that he is doing a good job and after he is done he takes off the towel and I get a final look at my haircut . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I nod my head , pay him for the haircut and also a tip and leave the barbershop after that . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I have to take a shower afterwards for some hair that happened to get down the back of my shirt . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I had decided that I wanted to visit my friend Paul whom lives quite a distance away . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
With this and my fear of air travel in mind I decided to take a train . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After researching and finding one online I was well on my way to going to see my friend Paul . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
I drive to the station and decide that I am going to purchase a round trip ticket as this would be cheaper than just buying both tickets separately . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I purchase my ticket and then go to sit down and wait for my train . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Whenever my train arrives I have to get in line as they process our tickets . 	1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
After all this is done I decide to take a seat by the window . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I sit and fall asleep a bit as I ride on the train for hours . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After a couple hours we finally reach the destination and I get off the train , excited to see my friend . 	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Yesterday I was riding around my neighborhood on my bicycle when I drove over a rusty nail hiding between the bricks on the sidewalk . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I had to walk my bike home . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
Today , I went to the store to buy a flat tire repair kit . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I took the tire off the bike and located the nail so I could remove it . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
After removing the nail , I let the remainder of the air out of the tire . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The next step was to pry the tire off of the rim . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I got my flat head screwdriver and was able to separate the rim from the tire and inner tube . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I pumped just enough air to find the leak in my tire where the nail had penetrated . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
After finding the hole , I buffed the area the hole was at and applied glue to it . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then I put a tire patch over the glue and let it sit for a few minutes . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put the inner tube and tire back on the rim , and pumped my tire up with air . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
The Long Awaited Bath I had been outside working in my garden all day . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
It was warm and humid outside so besides being caked in dirt , I also had sweated a lot and did not smell very good . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I wanted to get everything done in one day so I had worked very hard for a very long time . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
However , when I went inside to clean up , I realized from an automated message in my voice mail that the water had been shut off temporarily for emergency repairs , it would be on again in a few hours . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was frustrated , but I decided that I was hungry as well so I made myself a sandwich and cut up some fruit to eat . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I took off my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper and put on a clean t-shirt and shorts and then put down an old blanket on my couch before I sat on it so I would not get it dirty . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I watched part of a baseball game until I could not stand my own stench any more . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I went to try the water in my bath tub and was extremely glad when it worked . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I ran myself a hot bath and put some bubble bath soap in it . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I got in and found it very relaxing . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I was so glad to finally take a bath , get cleaned up , and relax after a long , hard , productive day . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was had a very stressful day at work and decided the best way to relax tonight was with a nice , warm bath . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I set down a few candles , not too many , and started the water . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After I let the water warm up a bit , I stopped the drain , and the tub slowly filled with warm water . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put in some mineral salts to help make the experience more pleasing . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once the tub was full , I took off all my clothes and got inside . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
For the most part , all I did was rest there and relax . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was a great way to slow things down on a fast-paced day . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
For several minutes , I just enjoyed the warm water but I made sure to wash up with soap and shampoo before the water got too cold . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Once , I was done I unplugged the tub drain and got to dry myself off . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
The last time that I flew in an airplane I bought a ticket to New Orleans . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I bought the ticket early to make sure it was as cheap as possible . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Then I started packing my bags to make sure I had everything that I needed for my trip . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I also planned to figure out how I was going to arrive at the airport . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
On the day of the flight , once I arrived at the airport , I checked one of my bags and proceeded to the TSA terminal . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
At the TSA the check your ID and make sure you do n't bring anything that is not allowed on the plane . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was not bringing anything that was not allowed so I got in with no problems . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After that I found my gate , waited a bit and boarded the plane . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
On the plane I looked out of the window and took some naps . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I needed to go on my weekly grocery shopping trip last weekend . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
So , I went to my fridge and started to make a list of the cold items that I would need . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Then , I checked out my cabinet to be sure that I picked up a few canned goods that I needed as well . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I checked through my coupons and took the ones that I needed . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I grabbed my wallet , helmet , sunglasses , and my insulated backpack and went outside to get on my bike . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After going through traffic , I arrived at the store and parked my bike . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I went into the store and grabbed one of the smaller carts , since I would not need to get too many things this trip . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I put my backpack and helmet in the cart and went inside . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I just needed some cream , milk , eggs , sausage , cheese , and some veggies . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I dodged around other shoppers and headed towards the veggies . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Salad blends were on sale , so I picked some up . 	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I also grabbed a nice head of broccoli as well . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Then I went to the refrigerated section and selected my meats and things , being sure to check for discounted meats . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
My list was all checked off so I went to the self-checkout to pay . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I scanned my items , ran my coupons , and paid . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0

Last month I decided to visit my grandmother . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
She lives about three hours away from me , and I do not own a car . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
To get to her house safely , I wanted to take a train . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Trains are a very affordable way to travel , and I find them to be comfortable and pleasant . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I got on my computer , and went to the website where people buy train tickets . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
I chose a date to leave and I booked my tickets . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
My tickets were emailed to me and I printed them off using my printer . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
A week later , I went to the train station and boarded the train . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
The ride was very quiet , so I took a nap part of the ride . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
The seats were very comfortable . 	0 1 0 0 0 0
I went to the cafeteria cart on the train and bought coffee . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I enjoyed the coffee and drank it while looking out the window . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

I needed to visit my Grandma upstate , so I decided to take a train . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I purchased my tickets online and printed out a receipt . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I packed a bag . 	1 0 0 1 0
The next day , I headed over to the train station and checked in at the ticket counter . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I was early , so I picked a spot on a bench and sat down . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
After a short while , everybody lined up to get on the train . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
A train worker checked all of our tickets . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I entered the train and picked out a seat for myself . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then I loaded my bag overhead . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0
Once everyone was on the train , our conductor announced that we were leaving the station . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Another train worker came around and took everyone 's tickets from them . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I spent the ride looking at scenery out the window and reading mostly . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Eventually , the train conductor announced my stop . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
I retrieved my bag from the overhead compartment , and headed downstairs and off of the train . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I 'd been looking forward to reading Tigerman , the new novel by my favorite writer , Nick Harkaway . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
However , I do n't like paying for the hard cover editions of books , and the paperback version would not be released for another year . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I therefore decided to walk to my local library and borrow the book . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
To my disappointment , it was already checked out , but I was able to place a hold on the book . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Six weeks later , the library sent me an e-mail to let me know that Tigerman had been returned and I could now check it out . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I stopped by on my way home from work that evening , and got the book . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It was a fun read , but I was not able to finish it by the due date , so I went online and obtained an extension of the due date . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
A few days later , I finished the book , which was wonderful . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I wanted other people to be able to enjoy it too , so I promptly returned the book to the library . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After a long week , I decided on a whim to take a bath . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
It had been years since I last took one ; I honestly could n't remember the last time . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
As soon as I got home from work , I kicked off my shoes , and walked excitedly up to the master bathroom . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I plugged the tub , and started running the water . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I adjusted the temperature until it was just right : not too hot , not too cold , just warm and comfortable . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
After a few drops of the bath liquid , bubbles filled the tub as the floral aroma filled the air . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I slowly took off the last of my garments , finally free from everything . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I quickly grabbed a glass of wine and when I returned , the tub was full and ready . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I slipped into the tub and soaked in the bliss . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I lounged for what seemed like hours . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Before I knew it , the wine was gone and I was starting to prune . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
My bath was done . 	1 1 0 0 0
I got out and dried the last of the relaxing water off of my body as the last of the bath went down the drain . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Though my bath was over , I felt the relaxing affects for hours . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Yesterday I went grocery shopping . 	1 1 0 0 0 0
First I sat down and made a list of all the food I would need for the next week . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I grabbed my reusable shopping bags and the list , grabbed my wallet and car keys , then started up the car and drove to the store . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I got to the store I went and grabbed a shopping cart , then I went straight to the produce aisle and got all the fruits and vegetables on the list . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I worked my way to the opposite end of the store , making sure to grab everything that was on my list . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
As I went through the store I picked up the things on my list and put them into my shopping cart . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
When I had everything I went up to the checkstand and placed the items onto the conveyer belt , so the person could scan them and ring me out . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
After the cashier had totaled up my bill , I handed him my money and he handed me back my change . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
He put all the groceries into my bags for me , then I carried them out to the car and went home . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I wanted to visit my friend in the city , but I did n't have a car . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
So , I decided to take the train . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I walked to the train station and went up to the ticket counter . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I asked for a ticket to the city where my friend lived and asked for the one that would depart the soonest . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The ticket person sold me a ticket and I paid for it in cash . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I called my friend and told them when I would be arriving to the train station near them . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I waited by the train terminal for my train . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
When the train arrived I boarded the train and took a seat . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The train passed many stops and finally I reached the stop that I wanted . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I got off the train and saw my friend waiting for me to pick me up . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
The train had arrived at exactly the time that was stated on the ticket . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I found myself in my youth in a precarious and annoying position . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Not only did I live in the very rough part of town with theives , drug dealers , and crack addicts , but I was without reliable transportation . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I did , however , have enough money for bus fare . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
As the job search continued I found an oportunity on the other side of town working for Subway . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I utilized the bus service . 	1 0 0 1 1 0
The characters on the bus were generally normal people but there were always a few outliers that were a bit intimidating . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Most of these reeked of alcohol and insanity . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
They were probably homeless people . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
I usually did n't talk to too many people on the bus , just kept to myself . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I would go to the transfer spot in downtown , and switch to the bus that would take me to my final location at Subway . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
The only time I have ever planted a tree was as a memorial . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
We had raised the funds to buy the tree . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I went to Home depot to pick out the tree . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I know nothing about trees , so I had the employee at Home Depot help me . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
She helped me decide the best tree for the area that we were planting it . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
One that would n't need much work or upkeep . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then she showed me what else I would need for the tree . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I bought soil and a shovel . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0
We went to the park where we were planting the tree and dug the hole for the tree . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After we place the tree and put in the supports , we filled the hole back in , packing the soil tight . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
We said a few words and watered the tree . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Lastly , we put the memorial plaque in front of the tree since it was a memorial for someone who has passed . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
There are six people living in my house , so going grocery shopping is usually a weekly occurrence . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I do n't mind doing it though , because I like picking out what food to buy . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I usually go on the morning with my sister . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
We get in the car and drive over to the closest grocery store which is about three miles away . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
We also take a list of items with us so we do n't forget what we need to buy . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
When we arrive at the store we park the car and get out . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I will grab a shopping cart near the store entrance and then we go inside . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
We then take a look at our shopping list and begin gathering all the items . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It takes us about 30 minutes to find everything . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
We then go to the checkout and pay for all the stuff . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then we go back to our car and drive home . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I have actually planted a few trees in my day . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I helped my mom plant a few fruit trees that she had bought . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
Interestingly enough , we never leave them in the pot , but we never put them in the ground dirt either . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
We start out by digging a pretty deep hole . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Depending on the size of the tree and the roots , its usually about a foot and a half deep and about a foot wide . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
we then put soft planting soil in the bottom to make sure that the tree will have more nutrition . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My mom also has manure that she uses sometimes , but I let her handle that one . 	1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
After we have everything set up , we take the tree out of the pot , and gently spread out the roots to make sure they can grow with some more space . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then we stick in in the hole , and put more dirt and whatever around it and gently pack it in . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
After all that , we find a stake of some sort and tie it next to the tree so it has something to keep it upright while it grows . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Last week I got a phone call for a job interview , and I decided I should clean myself up before going there . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
The major thing I needed to do was get a haircut since my hair had become long and unkempt . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I went over to the local barber and signed into the waiting list . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I sat around waiting my turn , which took about 15 minutes . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When they called my name I got up and sat in the barber chair . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
The barber asked me what kind of haircut I wanted , and I just told them to give me a professional look . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
They were good at their job so they knew exactly what to do . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The hair cutting process took about 10 minutes to finish , and once it was over I looked in the mirror and was very pleased with the result . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went to the front desk and paid , and I also gave the barber a tip . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
The easiest cake for me to make is Cheesecake . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Throw eggs , sugar , cream cheese and flavor in a bowl and you have the filling . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Pour that filling in a cookie crust , bake at 350 for one hour , remove and freeze . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I like strawberries on my cheesecake . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0
I slice up a few strawberries , pour sugar over them add a little and then place on top of frozen cheesecake . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It is so good that your whole family will enjoy it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
My love of cooking came from my mother . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
She used let me help her in the kitchen . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
When she made cakes and pies and used the mixer , she would let me lick the bowl . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I would get frosting , cake batter and pie filling on my jaws and face . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
But I didn ' t care about that . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Those times were the few times that my siblings and I didn ' t complain about cleaning up the kitchen . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I wish I could have a day like one of those days just once again . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
As I was bring my bike out of the garage I realized the rear tire had flat and there was clearly a small hissing sound where there was a puncture . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I got my tools and loosened and removed the nuts holding the tire on the bike . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Using a screwdriver I wedged underneath the tire removing it from the metal wheel . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I removed the tire tube and cleaned off the punctured area with a dry cloth . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I put tire repair glue on the hole and placed a tire patch on the glue and held it tight for several minutes until the glue dried . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I filled it up to ensure the hole was not leaking any air . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put the tube back in the tire and re-attached it to the wheel tightening the bolts . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Again I filled the tire with air and took my bike for a ride . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I was successful repairing my flat tire . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Today I decided to visit one of my friends that I have n't seen in a very long time . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
They just moved into a new apartment and they invited me over . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
They gave me their address but I was n't sure how to get there by train . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The first thing I did when I got to the train station was see what train goes to their neighborhood . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
After I figured that out , I made sure I had enough money on my metro card to pay the train fare . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
After going through the turnstile I waited on the train platform for the train to enter the station . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I quickly found a seat on the train since not to many people were on it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After about 25 minutes I finally arrived at the stop I was supposed to get off at . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I walked up the stairs and exited the train station and walked 2 blocks away to where my friend lives . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
He was happy to see me . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Riding a public bus is n't something I look forward to doing . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
When I was a teenager some friends convinced me that it would be fun to jump on a bus and ride around . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Having done so , I disagree , it is n't fun . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
However , for some people the bus is the only mode of transportation available . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Riding the bus does require a little research . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
You have to know which line you are riding , whether it is an express or whether it will be making many stops . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
You must also have the appropriate amount of fare ready to pay . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Once on board the bus , it 's best to find a hopefully clean seat nearby a normal looking person . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Since bus fare is quite cheap and anyone can use it , they do tend to attract undesirable types , so it 's best to be aware of that fact and watch yourself and your belongings closely . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
Listen and watch to make sure you do n't miss your stop , since busses do get crowded and you do n't want to miss it . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Last week was my friend 's birthday . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
I asked him if he was going to do anything special and he said no . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I felt bad for him , so I said I would at least bake him a cake . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Maybe this was a hasty decision since I have no experience baking cakes . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
So I looked online to see what I needed to do . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I found a recipe that looked easy enough , so later that day I drove over to the grocery store to buy all the ingredients I would need to bake the cake . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I got to the store I started gathering up everything I needed . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
Once I almost had everything I turned down an aisle and noticed there were boxed of pre-made cake mix I could buy . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
This seemed like an easy option , so I put all the ingredients back and bought one of those mixes . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I got home and started baking . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0
All I needed to add to the mix was a couple eggs and some vegetable oil . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
After it was in the oven for an hour the cake was ready . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I live in an area with good train and bus coverage . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I typically choose the train as it is more predictable but for some parts of the city that the train can not reach , I will take the bus . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The bus stations are typically outdoors so depending on where I 'm going I 'll head to the nearest bus stop . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
There 's an app that shoes when the next bus is coming so I 'll take out my phone to see how long the wait is . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Typically the wait is about 10-15 minutes . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Once the bus arrives , I take out my transit card to tap on the machine that collects the fare . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
This is done at the very beginning at the entrance of the bus . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once I hear the beep notifying me that the fare has been collected I will take a seat upstairs if it 's a double decker bus . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
The view is much better from the top and there are usually seats at the top . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Now it 's time to sit back and enjoy the ride and get off at my destination . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Sometimes , something happens that can really just ruin your day . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Take , for example , going for a fun bicycle ride only to have the tire go flat ! 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
When something like this happens , it can seem like a big deal , but is only a small inconvenience . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I do n't even know how to repair a flat bicycle tire , but I know how I could do it myself . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
First , I would read about how to fix it and maybe look at a video from the internet . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After I have learned how to repair it , I would go to the store to get some supplies . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I would need the tools to fix it and a new tire or things to use for the repair . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After arriving home , I would review the things I learned about how to repair the tire and I would follow the directions . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Once it was repaired , I would test out the bicycle to make sure it was repaired and then I would clean up . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I have really long hair so I tend to trim my hair myself . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
If I need to go in to get it done , it 's because I need a really good trim . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
My hair goes all the way down almost to my butt , so I am very leery of letting other people mess with my hair . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I will sit there and listen to them say how much they think needs to be trimmed and then tell them how much I want trimmed and it ends up somewhere in between . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
It is really annoying when you have long hair and want to keep it that way and the girl who chops it off just does n't understand some people happen to like having it really long . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
So , I usually avoid going and getting it cut , and just trim it myself . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
It 's easy , I know what I want , I wo n't chop it all off , and if I screw up I have no one to blame but myself . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

We prefer to ride on trains because they are cheaper and we can enjoy the scenery along the way . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
We arrive at the train station at 5:30 am , snacks and blankets in tow in our bags . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
We purchased our tickets the other day , so we did n't have to worry about going to a booth to buy any . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

We hopped onto the train and took our seats towards the back of the train so that we could discuss a lot of what we were going to say and do in the meetings for our trip without being distracted much . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
As we discussed our plans and strategies , we 'd occasionally look out the window and see lush trees and valleys , animals , plains , and all manner of environments as we traveled from state to state . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
We had to switch trains a few times at different stations , but the process was pretty smooth and it is always nice to hear that whistle and the ALL ABOARD ! 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0

On the day of my flight , I arrived early so that I would have time to go through the security line , where they made me take off my shoes and my belt , and put my bag through the x-ray machine . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0

I decided to bake a chocolate cake yesterday . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
First , I consulted my recipe book and found the recipe I wanted to use . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
Next , I looked through my kitchen and made sure that I had all the ingredients that I needed for my cake . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I did have them , so I began to pull them all out . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I preheated the oven , and greased a cake pan . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I mixed up all of the ingredients in a big mixing bowl . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I poured the mixture carefully into the cake pan . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I carefully placed it into the oven and set the timer according to the recipe . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
While the cake was baking , I cleaned up the mess in the kitchen . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I made chocolate frosting to go on the cake . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
The timer buzzed , I pulled the cake out of the oven and saw that it was done . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I set it out to cool . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Once it was cool , I took the frosting I had just made and frosted the cake . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The cake was complete and I served it to my family for dessert after dinner that night . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Last night , I made a grocery list and went shopping . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
To make a list , I go through my cabinets and refrigerator and write down things that I am out of . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
These are always the same things like coffee and milk . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Then I thought of some recipes I wanted to make . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I wrote down pasta shells , ricotta cheese , Parmesan cheese , spinach , and tomato sauce . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I am going to make stuffed shells this week ! 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I got to the store , I got my reusable bags out of the car . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Using no plastic bags is a great way to help the environment . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Since I went to the store around 8 p.m. , it was n't very crowded . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I could relax as I moved my way from produce , dry goods , and then dairy . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I saw a huge display of Easter candy because it is March and the holiday is coming up . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I was so tempted to buy a lot of chocolate but I did n't . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I only try to get treats once in awhile . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Finally , I went to the front check out . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
The cashier was nice and the bagger was happy to use my own bags . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I got home and put everything away . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Now I ca n't wait to make my stuffed shells for dinner ! 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I prefer a shower over a bath , but when I need to take a bath it 's to relax from a stressful evening . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Taking a bath requires filling the whole tub up with warm water . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
This may take some time and I will have to be sure to have a stopper to prevent the water from draining away from the tub . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
While the water is filling up , I will add the bubble bath solution to make the water soapy and fragrant . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
The aroma in the bath is what de-stresses me . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Usually it 'll be a nice lavender smell or something not too strong but is very pleasant to smell . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once the tub is filled , I will slowly enter myself into the water . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
This can be tough at first because the water is usually too hot in the beginning so I will ease myself in . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
But once in , the bath will really work to help get the blood circulating to get a nice feeling of relaxation . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I will typically stay in until the water is no longer warm or the bubbles have gone away . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
So when the water is just lukewarm , I will drain the tub and then rinse off using the normal shower . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Yesterday I went to the library to borrow a book . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I was interested in learning more about birdwatching so I thought the library would be a great resource . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I asked the librarian where the books on nature and birds were . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
She told me the call numbers of the aisle and I went to that aisle . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Each book had a small sticker on the spine indicating the call number . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
The books are organized by subject , so reading the call numbers is helpful for finding things . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I browsed through the books on birds . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I picked one up and flipped through it . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It had a lot of beautiful photos and interesting facts and tips for watching birds . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I decided this would be a great book to start with . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I brought my book to the circulation desk and waited in line . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
When it was my turn , I handed the librarian my library card . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0
She scanned the book , opened up the flap , and stamped the due date on the inner card . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I 'd be able to borrow the book for three weeks . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When the due date came , I would return it to the front desk or the book drop box . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
The other day my dad was riding his bike and started having trouble steering . 	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
He rode the bike back home and then took it into the back yard to have a look at it . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
He noticed that the front tire was flat and was n't keeping air in it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
He took it off the bike . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0
First he pumped it up and tried to see if the tire would hold air . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It would not . 	1 0 0 0
Then he rubbed liquid dish detergent on the tire and pumped it up and looked for where it bubbled to see where the hole was . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Once he found the hole , he decided if it needed a patch or a plug . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It was a small round hole so he decided to put a plug in it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
He got the packages of plugs and found one that was the right size . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
He followed the instructs on the package to insert the plug into the hole and secure it . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
He pumped the tire back up and it held air . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
He put the tire back on the bike . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Last summer , I was riding my bike and I must have ran over something sharp because my tire started going flat . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I tried to use a repair kit , but the hole was too big and the patch would not stay on the old tube . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It turns out that I ran over a screw and it had been lodged through the tire and into the tube . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I knew that I had a twenty six inch wheel , so I went up to the local hardware store . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
They had a new tube and I bought a new tire , just in case there were any other problems . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I followed the instructions and I took the old tire off . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
The somehow got the new tube and tire onto the wheel , but it was kind of a pain to do . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I finally got it on and all that I had to do was put in some air . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I plugged in my air compressor but it would not turn on for some reason . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I found an old tire pump buried in my garage and I was finally able to put air into the tires . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
In the future , I am going to be more careful to avoid sharp exits because repairing the flat tire was a pain . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Yesterday on my way home from work I heard a loud popping noise and nearly lost control of my bicycle . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
After coming to a stop I noticed that my tire was flat . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I ended up having to walk my bike the rest of the way home as I did not have any tools to repair the tire on the spot . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once I returned home I found a can of spray foam that I thought might do the trick if I sprayed it into the tire . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I sprayed the foam in and it filled the inside walls of the tire . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I was happy with my ingenuity , although I knew this was only a temporary fix and I should probably replace the tire . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After the tire was filled I hopped on and rode to my local bike shop where I purchased a replacement tire to put on my bike at a later date . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I was riding my bike home when I noticed that it had a flat tire . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Lucky for me there was a hardware store near by . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I walked in and purchased a patch kit . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
It was only a few dollars . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
They loaned me a chanellock to get the tire off . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
It came off easy and I pulled the tire off the rim . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It had a nail hole so I took the wire scrubber in the repair kit and scruffed up the rubber . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I applied the risen and stuck on the patch , and I held thumb pressure on it for a few minutes . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I started putting the tire back on the rim , which was easy I got it back on the bike . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Lucky for me the hardware store had a portable tire air filler and I was able to fill the tire . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

I walked into the salon , told the girl at the desk why I was there , and sat down in one of their comfy chairs to wait . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I browsed through magazines while I waited . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
My hair stylist walked up and told me she was ready . 	1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
She took me to her chair , I sat down and we talked about what I wanted done that day . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then she walked me over to the hair washing station . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I sat down and leaned my head back and she washed my hair with warm water and really nice smelling shampoo . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When she was done , she towel dried my hair and we walked back to her station . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I sat down , she put a cape around me to catch the hair she cuts . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
And she began to cut my hair . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
When she finished she blew it dry and asked me how I liked it . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I loved it . 	1 0 1 0
So we walked over to the desk , I paid my bill , left her a tip , and left the salon . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Yesterday I visited my hairdresser for a haircut . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I went to the salon and asked for a haircut with a wash . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The receptionist said it would be a 15 minute . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I said that would be fine , and sat down . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
On the table in front of me were a selection of magazines . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I picked '' `` People '' '' and browsed through it as I waited . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Soon , the hairdresser called my name and I sat down in the chair . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
She asked me how I 'd like my hair cut . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
I told her I wanted a trim with some layers . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
She asked me if I wanted a wash . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I said yes . 	1 0 1 0
She took me first to get my hair washed . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
She waited until the water was warm , then started spraying my hair . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Once it was soaked , she lathered my hair first with shampoo , then with conditioner . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After that , she rinsed my hair off and put a towel over my head . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Back in the chair , she soaked up the extra water from my hair with the towel . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Then she began to style my hair . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
After about half an hour , my haircut was done . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I took a look in the mirror and told my hair stylist she did a good job . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I tipped her and paid my bill . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Finally , I left the salon . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It was a hard day , so I looked forward to making myself the perfect bath . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I get home from work and head straight for the bathtub . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I run the water until it 's the perfect temperature and plug the drain to allow the water to fill the tub . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I take some bath salts and oils to drizzle underneath the stream of water to allow it to dissolve and it fills the room with gentle fragrance . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
As the tub continues to fill with water , I grab some candles and carefully place them around the tub . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After lighting the candles and setting up a towel and robe for getting out , I put on some quiet music to drown out the sound of my husband 's hockey game . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
I grab a small towel to use as a pillow for my neck and finally get in the bath . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I feel like I 'm melting as I shut my eyes and allow myself to relax . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I do n't realize how long I 'm in there until I open my eyes and see my husband standing over me . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
The water has lost all its warmth . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
He had put the towel in the dryer and it was now warm , fluffy , and welcoming . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I step out of the day as my troubles swirl down the drain . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Before I go grocery shopping I make a list . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know I am out or low on something . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I try to only go once a week unless there is something I really need for a specific meal . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I do n't like to jump lines if one line seems to be moving faster . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Good to have a little bit of patience . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I try to remember to bring my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting plastic bags . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I needed a hair cut one day . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It had been quite a while since my last cut , and the ends of my hair were starting to look uneven and ragged . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
While I was driving one day , I found a sign for a haircut for only $ 5 . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
What a great deal ! 	0 0 0 1 0
I decided to go ahead and stop in for a quick trim . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went inside and signed my name on the waiting list . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I found a chair to sit in and looked around . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
There were a lot of people there ! 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
It must have been because of the great deal on the hair cut . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Because it was busy , I had to wait a while , but eventually my name was called . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I told the beautician I had my hair cut not that long before and just wanted my ends to be cleaned up so my hair looked better . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
She put a cape around my shoulders and took me to wash my hair . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
After washing my hair , she cut off a half of an inch and used a blow dryer . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I paid for my haircut , left a tip for the beautician , and left the salon feeling light and beautiful . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
