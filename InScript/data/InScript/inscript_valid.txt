There are many ways to plant a tree . 
One of the least expensive is planting a bare root tree . 
I had to chose the right tree for my area and my particular situation . 
My local nursery carries only plants suited to our area , but since I bought from a catalog I checked for suitability in a Sunset Garden Book . 
I also had to site the tree properly . 
It could n't be under power lines , and needed room to spread . 
I finally planted a magnolia . 
It began as a bare root tree , and it now flowers every early spring , even in our drought . 
First , I dug a planting hole . 
The hole was wider at the bottom than at the top , and had a cone of firm soil in its center to support the tree . 
The hole was about five times as wide across as the tree . 
I started the hole with a shovel , but finished by hacking at the soil underground with a spade to undercut the hole and so the roots could get purchase when they started to spread . 
I set the bare root tree on the cone I left in the center of the hole and spread out its roots over the cone . 
I arranged the roots so the tree would be level , no roots would be exposed , and the upper bark would n't be buried . 
Then I nearly filled the hole with soil , firming it lightly by patting it as I went . 
When the hole was almost full , I watered slowly , holding the tree straight as the water soaked in . 
Then I filled up the hole completely . 
finally , I made a ring of soil around the tree , to hold in water when the rainy season ended and I would have to irrigate . 
I used no fertilizer or amendments when I planted , because our sandy soil is fairly fertile , and I did n't want to make a dividing line that would encourage the tree to grow only in its tiny pothole of enriched soil . 
I wanted it to spread its roots , and it has . 
It is important to have hair that is clean , groomed and presentable . 
One key component to good hair is getting it cut . 
The way I like it cut is best done within the confines of a beauty school . 
To set up a cut at the beauty school which I like to go to , I call in a day or two before to set up an appointment . 
At the appropriate appointment time I make my way to the school and check in . 
A friendly student always greets me and steers me to her station . 
I explain to him or her thoroughly what I like done to my hair . 
It helps that I always bring photos in to show what I would like it cut like . 
As they cut my hair I always chat with them . 
I like getting to know people and this is always enjoyable for me and for my stylist . 
At the end of the cut , they brush off all the hair and ask how I like it . 
I always give glowing praise . 
I pay for the cut and am on my way . 
I like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving . 
One time , when I lived in Alaska , I rode on a train from Fairbanks to Denali park . 
Just like with all train rides , I had to buy a ticket first and then I had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station . 
Then I climbed onto the train and picked a seat . 
The different places you can sit in a train are called cars . 
You do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit . 
So , I picked one in a car in the back and sat right beside the window . 
After the train started moving , a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then I stood up to walk around . 
You can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car and stand outside , so I did that . 
It was very fun to be standing outside while the train was moving and I hung onto the railing to be sure I was safe . 
Then I went back inside and went to the dining car where I bought a sandwich and water . 
After I got back to my seat , I ate and watched the scenery through the window . 
I saw lots of interesting things including a moose and we arrived at Denali right after that . 
My grandpa needed help recently planting a bunch of apple trees on his property . 
After going to the nursery , we picked a perfect place for them to go and made sure to place them the appropriate distance apart . 
We grabbed the shovels he had in his shed and started digging the holes . 
After digging them all out , we carefully placed them into their spots and made sure to give them plenty of room and filled the hole with nutrients and very fresh soil . 
We made sure to give the newly planted trees plenty of water so that they would establish their roots very quickly and grow into very healthy trees . 
The first stage of planting a tree is the most important and we wanted to make sure to do it right . 
After we were done , we put all of our tools back and looked at our hard work . 
It was a fun experience and the trees ended up growing beautifully . 
I decided to take a trip to Europe . 
First , I went online and found tickets to the destination , Bulgaria . 
Then , I purchased those online tickets with my credit card and printed out the receipt with my printer . 
I went into my bedroom and packed all of my bags . 
Then I called a taxi . 
Once the taxi arrived , I put my bags into the trunk of the taxi and the taxi driver drove me to the airport . 
At the airport , I waited in the line for Delta flights to check in my bags . 
Once my bags were checked in , I got my boarding pass . 
Next , I went to the second floor of the airport terminal , where my carry on luggage was scanned and I was searched . 
Then , I went to my gate and saw the airplane waiting outside on the loading arm . 
After 20 minutes , the stewardess made an announcement that the airplane was boarding . 
I got on the flight , took my seat and the airplane took off . 
Then I flew in the plane for 5 hours . 
In need of a new series to sink my teeth into , I decided to head to the public library . 
I ca n't seem to go long without reading some mythical , crazy fantasy ! 
Anyway , when I got to the Library , I sat down at their computer where you can look up where certain books are in the library . 
I found where the fantasy section was and headed over to that shelf . 
Oh my goodness , there were more books than I could ever imagine ! 
I was practically drooling ! 
I saw the series I was looking for and decided to get just the first book in the series -LRB- so I do n't binge read -RRB- . 
I took the book up to the front counter and handed the librarian my member card so that I could check the book out . 
She looked the book over and commented that it was one of her favorites which made me smile . 
With the book now checked out , I slipped it into my page and made my way home . 
I was ready to dive into a new adventure ! 
Getting a hair cut can be a stressful activity . 
You have to know where you are going to go for this service and how much you want to spend . 
Some people have one hair dresser they like and stick with that person over years . 
I have n't had such luck , so I sometime have to take a gamble and just make an appointment at a random salon . 
If I want a new look , I 'll make sure to be prepared with an example picture of exactly what I want , or if I just want a trim I coach myself into being very firm about not cutting too much . 
I try to get to my appointment early , in case they 're ready to see me sooner than they expected . 
There is generally small talk back and forth during the process , which can be uncomfortable for socially awkard folks like myself , but I muddle through it somehow . 
If I am happy with my service and with how my hair looks , I make sure to leave a generous tip . 
Flying in an airplane can be a stressful event for some people , but In essence it 's a simple process . 
You will need to purchase tickets ahead of time to a destination of your choosing . 
Once you decide on your trip , and book any accomodations , you will just need to show up to your airport at least 2 hours in advance . 
It 's important to show up early to prevent rushing , and make sure you get through security in a timely manner . 
Make sure you bring a comfy neck pillow in your carry on , and purchase any beverages after you go through security to take on the plane with you . 
Once through security you can head to your gate and wait until your flight starts boarding . 
When your section is called you can enter the plane , stow away your carry on , and sit back and relax . 
The rest of the work will be done for you , and you can feel free to take a nap or watch an in-flight movie . 
When you arrive at your destination they will have everyone exit the plane , and your vacation can really begin ! 
The previous night and this morning before work I noticed I was missing a lot of necessary ingredients for my future meals . 
I planned out a trip to the grocery store immediately after work . 
After I finished working I drove over to the store . 
It was very crowded but not too hard to find a parking spot . 
Once inside the store , I grabbed the nearest shopping cart and smiled as one of the grocery workers welcomed me in . 
Once inside and out of everyone 's way , I thought about what I needed . 
Since I did n't have a list written down , it took me a few minutes . 
Once I came up with the list in my head , I started to map out a route in my head that would take the least amount of time for me to follow in the store . 
First , I picked up my deli . 
They offered me some free samples of the meat I asked for . 
Then I picked up my bread which was right nearby . 
At the back wall of the store I found the meat I was going to cook tonight . 
After that , I grabbed a few extra items that I thought might also be nice later this week while heading towards checkout . 
Luckily , there was n't a line and this was done quickly . 
I paid with my debit card and left with all my groceries in a cart , packed them into my car , and headed home . 
I needed a vacation so I went online and booked myself a ticket from my local airport to Mexico . 
As the day arrived , I packed everything I needed into a carry on bag and headed to the airport . 
Once there I got my ticket printed out and checked in . 
I had to go through security and then wait for about 45 minutes at the terminal . 
Once they announced boarding , I got in line and walked onto the plane . 
I then stowed my carry on bag above me and put my backpack under the seat in front of me . 
I got situated with a book and put my seatbelt on . 
During the flight I put in some ear buds and listened to music while I read . 
I got a water from the flight attendant and a small bag of peanuts . 
Once the plane landed , everyone got up and waited for a while as the people in front slowly filed out . 
When it was finally my turn I grabbed my carry on bag from above and exited the plane . 
I was invited to my friend 's housewarming party this weekend and although we were n't asked to bring anything I wanted to bring something . 
Knowing that my friend loves chocolate cake I decided to bake her one . 
I went to the kitchen and grabbed a large bowl , a whisk , a cake pan , and the ingredients for the cake . 
I went to preheat the oven and in the meantime I grabbed the bowl and added chocolate cake mix , eggs , milk , and butter . 
I mixed the ingredients with my whisk until my desired consistency . 
I buttered the inside of the cake pan then added the cake batter into the pan . 
Once the oven preheated and was ready I put the cake into the oven . 
An hour later the cake was ready . 
I let it cool a bit then started to frost the cake with frosting I purchased from the store . 
I added some strawberries on top for decoration . 
My friend loved the cake . 
Last week when I went biking on a trail with a friend , she rode over a nail and one of her bike tires was punctured . 
We immediately stopped riding so that we could fix the problem , and we were lucky that it was n't too bad of an issue . 
To fix it , we had to return home and take care of it with the tools we had there . 
We turned the bike over so it was resting on the handlebars and the seat so that we would have access to the wheel very easily . 
Upon spinning the wheel , we found the nail she had run over and removed it . 
We had to release all the air from the tube to begin with , then take the tire off of the rim using tools called a tire levers . 
After we had that off , we had to remove the tube from the tire and inflate it with enough air to find the hole . 
We knew about where it would be . 
Using a piece of my brother 's chalk , we marked where the hole was so we would n't lose the spot , and then we took the air out of the tube again . 
Using a patch kit designed for this kind of issue , we patched up the hole and put the tube back into the tire . 
We put the tire back on the wheel and re-inflated it . 
The patch worked perfectly and we were able to go out biking again the next day ! 
Yesterday , I found that my bicycle tire was flat and would have to be repaired . 
First , I went to the store in town to purchase a machine that would inflate my bike tire . 
Next , I went to my garage , which is where I keep my bike . 
I found the nozzle in the bike tire where the air is supposed to be pumped into . 
I plugged the machine into the wall socket and then attached the nozzle from the machine onto the nozzle on the bike . 
I hit the switch , which caused the machine to beep as it added air into the tire . 
I watched the gauge on the machine to make sure there was n't too much pressure ; I did n't want my tire to pop like a balloon . 
Finally , when I saw that there was enough air in the tire , I turned off the machine and removed it before closing the bike 's tire nozzle tight . 
Now my tire is good as new and I can ride around wherever I 'd like to go . 
I 'm glad I got this important job done . 
I began to repair my flat bicycle tire by removing the wheel from the bike . 
This was done by disconnecting the brake cable so the wheel would be able to be removed from the frame . 
I then loosened the bolts holding it on and slid the axle off the frame , making sure that the chain did not get caught or bind up while doing so . 
After the wheel was removed , I made sure that all possible air was out of the tube so that it would be easier to remove . 
I next took two flat head screwdrivers and began to remove the tire from the bicycle . 
After the tire was finally removed , I pulled the tube off the rim as well . 
Next , I placed a new tube in place making sure that the valve stem was placed through the rim appropriately . 
After doing this , I began to fit the tire to the rim , making sure the tube was placed inside the tire and not pinched at all . 
Once the tire was on the rim , I inflated the tube , making sure that the tire seated onto the rim properly and that everything held air . 
Finally , I reinstalled the wheel onto the bike , and reconnected everything appropriately . 
Why buy a book when you can borrow one from the library ? 
Your local library has a wealth of resources just waiting for you to explore . 
Before you check anything out , you will need a library card . 
Typically , you will need to prove who you are and where you live . 
Your drivers license will probably work for that . 
Go to your local library and get a card . 
Once you have done that , you are ready to check things out ! 
The library is divided into different categories . 
One area will be fiction , which is also occasionally broken down into smaller departments . 
Non-fiction is divided by the type of book . 
There is reference , gardening , crafting , home repair , history , science , cooking , parenting , and any other subject you can imagine . 
When you have found a book you want , either by browsing the aisles or by searching through the card catalog , select it and take it to the front desk . 
They will scan your card and let you take the book home for a week or two ! 
I walked onto the plane and was greeted by the stewardess who had a very kind smile . 
I walked slowly behind the other passengers as people were shoving their luggage into the overhead compartments . 
I found my seat just ahead of the right wing . 
I buckled into my seat next to the window , and prepared myself for takeoff . 
The stewardess explained all the pre-flight information about safety . 
The plane started to taxi to the runway . 
My stomach started to get a little twisted . 
The engines started to roar and the passengers were pushed back into their seats . 
In a few seconds the plane started climbing and we were off . 
I watched the the trees and the buildings get smaller and smaller . 
After a few minutes we started to level off and everything on the ground looked miniature . 
We were above the clouds for most of the flight , but I still love looking out the window . 
As we began our descent , we went through rain clouds and it was a bit bumpy , but we landed safely and exited the plane the same way we began , slow and without efficiency . 
When I go grocery shopping I almost always take a list . 
So for me , the first step to shopping is list making . 
I list what I plan to cook this week , and also cleaning products and similar things . 
My favorite place to shop is a huge membership store , for its good prices . 
I pick up a shopping cart just outside the store . 
Then I enter , sometimes showing my membership card to the person at the door and sometimes getting in without showing it . 
I cruise past the impulse items just inside the door , and through the electronics and organic foods sections that come next . 
Next come many aisles with items like light bulbs and pillows . 
Finally I get to the food . 
There are usually people here offering samples of new food items . 
I often take some . 
I buy large packages of chicken or fish that can be frozen . 
Sometimes I buy fresh bread . 
I continue to the fresh fruit and vegetable section , where I try to restrain myself to what I can use . 
Next come the chiller and frozen foods , but I go past hem to pet food and paper goods . 
I get frozen food on the way back , and then a few canned food and dry goods . 
The last areas are pharmacy , which I mostly avoid , and the book section , where I 'm apt to linger . 
Then I wait in line for a while , pay , and leave the store . 
As I leave , someone checks my cart , to make sure what 's on my receipt matches the huge load I am carting home . 
I decided we needed some fruit trees on our property so ordered a three in one apple tree from a catalog . 
The three in one apple tree did n't need other apple trees for cross pollination because it had three different kinds of apples on its branches . 
A couple weeks later a the apple tree came in the mail . 
I opened the package and read the directions . 
I then grabbed a shovel and went and dug a hole that was twice as big as the base of the tree . 
Then I drove to the store to buy some potting mix which was highly encouraged in the apple trees instructions . 
Once home , I put the three in one apple tree into the hole I had dug . 
Then I put potting soil around the base of the tree . 
Then all that was left to do was keep it watered throughout the year . 
After enrolling in a basic college geometry class , I realized very early on that I needed to supplement what I was learning in class with an additional book that went over some of the basics that I had forgotten since high school . 
I went to the local library and searched through many of the ones that were available . 
The college course I was taking was very important and I wanted to do well in it . 
After 1 hour of searching I found a book that was perfectly written for people that wanted a refresher course in the subject of geometry . 
I read about 5 pages of it while in the library and realized that it was a perfect fit for my needs . 
I walked up to the checkout counter and checked out the book for two weeks . 
I took the book home and read it and I am very glad I did so . 
I am glad I have a great library nearby . 
Today , I decided I really needed to get a haircut , so I went by Lou ' s. Lou has been my barber since I first had hair , and my father went there before that . 
When you enter his place , he immediately says ' ? 
welcome ' . 
He sits you in his adjustable barber ' s chair , and gets just the right height while facing you toward his wall size mirror . 
He pulls out his comb and pulls it through your hair as you both talk about the length the hair needs to be , and whether you need a shave also . 
Then the magic happens . 
He turns you away from the mirror and starts clipping away , the whole time talking with you about the weather and sports . 
He asks about your family , and whether the fish are biting down at the local lake . 
In what seems just like seconds , Lou takes one last clip and spins you back to the mirror to show you his creation on your head . 
When you are satisfied , you pay him plus a little extra for the sheer perfection of this haircut , and tell him you will see him next month . 
I love to travel the USA , and recently , the world . 
Without the advent of the modern airplane this would be both very time consuming and very expensive . 
To save money , I like to research fares by time and location . 
We live in a small city so many times we can drive a few hours and save a lot of money by flying out of that airport . 
When I get to the airport , I check my bags and go through security . 
After passing through security , I like to check my email , talk to family and friends , and do some reading over a cup of coffee . 
Then we shut down the phone and get on the plane . 
I love the window seat and enjoy watching the clouds and the ground below us as we are flying to the destination . 
Upon landing I head out to the next destination . 
I was living in Austin Texas and decided I was going to try my luck at making a cake . 
I researched a few to try out . 
The first one that I made was a layered Italian cake with white frosting and coconut flakes . 
This one took a lot of effort due to the multiple layers , but the taste ended up being excellent . 
I thought I would try my luck next with a chocolate ganash frosting on top of a peanut butter cake . 
This cake came out better tasting in my opinion and the in the opinion of others . 
For the peanut butter portion of it , it had peanut butter mixed with actual butter baked on top of a graham cracker compressed crust . 
The ganash was made from melting chocolate in heavy whipping cream briefly in the microwave and spreading over . 
Once cooled it made kind of a shell on top of the peanut butter . 
On last Sunday morning my wife woke me up and told me its 11 o'clock and time to to get up . 
But I was very lazy on that day and I want to spend some more time on bed . 
I asked my wife to get me some coffee . 
She brought a very tasty hot coffee . 
Its aroma is spreading everywhere in my room . 
After having the coffee I got up and took a good shower . 
That time my wife prepared breakfast for me . 
So I had my breakfast and spent some time for reading news online . 
Then My wife came to me and asked what is my plan for our son 's birthday . 
I told her , '' `` oh ! 
I forgot . 
we have to plan something . 
That is on next Saturday '' '' . 
At last I reached a conclusion that this time I cook food by myself . 
So we need to make a list for groceries for that . 
My wife helped me to prepare a list . 
These days groceries are very pricey . 
So I checked the deals online . 
At last I found good deals in a grocery shop near my house . 
So me and my son went to the shop . 
My son likes grocery shopping very much . 
When we reached the grocery shop , I asked my son to sit in the cart . 
While we were moving inside the shop , I felt happy by seeing the deals of the day . 
Most of the groceries in my list are on sale . 
I bought almost everything in my list . 
I saved a lot on that day because of the deal . 
After paying the bill , we went out of the shop and kept everything inside the car and left to home . 
I was riding my bike along the road when a tire blew out . 
I dragged it back to my garage and began to repair my bicycle 's tire . 
I flipped the bike upside down and stood it up so that I could work on it from the bottom-up . 
I took off the old tire and began putting on the new one that I had around in my garage . 
Once I replaced the tire I flipped it back around to make sure that I had put it on correctly and once I had double checked that it was on correctly I started to ride my bike down the road to test the bicycle and the tire so that if there was something wrong with it I could figure it out now and not after in case I was in a situation , such as going down a hill , that it could be harmful to me in any way . 
Last year I had to go to my native place in India . 
While I was there , I thought of meeting one of my friends in Chennai . 
Chennai is 800 kms far away from my place and it takes about 15 hours if I drive . 
I decided to take train . 
I went online and booked tickets . 
The economy tickets were sold out so I had to book the expensive one . 
On the day of the travel , I arrived at the train station almost an hour before the actual departure time . 
Since it was a first class ticket , I could take more than enough luggage with me . 
After 15 minutes in to the journey , the ticket collector came by and checked my tickets . 
It was early in the morning and I was in a window seat . 
So I could watch all the scenery . 
Another good thing about the train is that once in a while I could get up and walk a stretch . 
Also , when I 'm hungry , I could get down at the station and buy any food as the train stops at the station for 10-15 minutes . 
Overall it was a wonderful experience . 
In the morning , I had to get ready to go to work . 
At the time , I did n't have a car , and the weather was too wet and windy to use a bicycle for transportation . 
After a quick breakfast , I got my good shoes on and a jacket . 
Out the door , I locked the deadbolt and went for the bus stop about 5 blocks away from my house . 
I called the bus lines number and input the code on my phone corresponding to the bus arrival at my stop , and realized I only had a 3 minute wait . 
The bus arrived , and I paid the fare for my 2-hour ticket . 
I went to the back of the bus , as there were no seats in the front . 
The bus came to life as it passed other stops without passengers , and we eventually got to the transit station , where I was able to walk by foot the rest of the way to my workplace . 
Reading is very important to me , and with the amount that I read , it is economical to use a library to borrow the books I would like to read . 
When borrowing a book , I get my son into the car and we drive to the library . 
Usually we find a few books for him to borrow as well , so we go to the children 's section first and pick out two or three books for him . 
That way , when we go to find a book for me , he has something to entertain him . 
Then we go to the fiction section for adults . 
Usually my son Ryan will sit on the floor looking at his books next to me while I find book to check out . 
I find a book or two and then Ryan and I go to the check out and use my library card to check out the books . 
The librarian usually puts them in a bag and then we leave the library to go home and enjoy our books . 
I thought about taking my usual shower today , but decided to take a bath instead . 
I have had a stressful week and the relaxation will do me good . 
I get everything ready that I will need-my towel , my bath beads , a book and a candle . 
I run the water just a bit on the warm side since I do n't want the bath getting cold too soon . 
I put the stopper in on the bath drain and then pour in my bath beads . 
Time to run the water . 
I 've lit my candle and grabbed my book . 
I love to soak for a bit , it 's so relaxing . 
I will get through a chapter or two of my book , depending how fast I feel like reading . 
The whole atmosphere is de-stressing me . 
After my bath , I will towel off and get into my pajamas . 
I always seem to sleep better after taking a relaxing bath . 
I made sure I had my ticket in advance and checked to make sure my flight was not canceled . 
I had pre-packed what I needed and doubled checked the list to make sure that all my items were approved . 
Then , I arrived at the airport about one and a half hours early . 
I made sure to go through security first , since there were long lines for that . 
I had to take off my shoes and put my bags through an x-ray . 
After I was done , I put my luggage in the correct area so it could be loaded on the plane . 
I waited until my plane was ready to board and showed the flight attendant my boarding pass . 
I stayed quietly on the plane and made sure I was in my assigned seat . 
It can be crowded and boring , so I read my book on the flight . 
I made sure to listen to the flight attendants when they had an announcement to make . 
I love to make cheesecake for my family . 
We have a family recipe that I follow when I cook . 
First I purchase the ingredients at the store and make certain I have everything I need . 
Then I make a crust from scratch in a cake pan , using crumbled cookies , nuts , brown sugar and vanilla flavor . 
I turn on the oven to pre-heat , as my oven is very slow to heat up . 
I use my electric mixer to whip the pats of cream cheese , making sure they are light and fluffy . 
Then I add in eggs , sugar , lemon juice and lemon zest until it is thoroughly combined into a thick liquid . 
I pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan and put it into the preheated oven for about 45 minutes . 
When the cake is slightly brown on top , I remove it from the oven and place it in the refrigerator to cool . 
This usually takes about two hours . 
Then it is ready to serve . 
Sometimes after a long , hard , stressful day at the office , the best thing to do when you get home is to take a nice , hot , relaxing bubble bath ! 
That is exactly what I did after coming home on Monday afternoon . 
I decided I would make it as relaxing as possible and pretend that I was at a spa . 
I went up to the bathroom and started to draw the warm water into the tub . 
While that was filling up I then went down to the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of wine and a glass and took it upstairs to sip as I soaked . 
To complete my ultimate relaxation bath night I grabbed my blue tooth speaker and set it up to play some relaxing music while I was in the tub . 
I then added some bubble bath and got in . 
First I washed my hair and then my body and then it was time to relax and soak until my skin started to look like a raisin . 
I visited the library and asked the main librarian where I could find the fiction books . 
I followed her instructions and then looked around the shelves for the mystery genre books . 
I browsed through the shelves of mystery books for a few minutes and picked out a few books that looked interesting . 
Then , I sat down in a comfy chair near the shelves and read the beginnings to the books I had chosen to see if I would really like them . 
I narrowed it down to one book that I found interesting and enjoyable to read . 
I placed the other books on a shelf to be returned to their proper place by the librarian . 
I took the book and went to the front of the library and pulled out my library card . 
I handed my library card and the book to the librarian and she scanned them both using her card scanner . 
She informed me of the due date of the book and I thanked her for her help . 
I left the library to go home . 
After a long day of gardening , I came inside to wash my hands . 
While washing them , I glanced at myself in the mirror and realized that I was much dirtier than I thought . 
I figured I should take a bath before doing anything else so as to not soil anything in my home . 
I turned off the sink , dried my hands , and set off in search of a bath towel and a change of clothes . 
I decided on a bath as I had a long day and it sounded so much more relaxing . 
Once I had the items I needed , I went back to the bathroom and turned the tub on . 
I turned the hot and cold nozzles both , and adjusted them as needed after testing the temperature with my hand . 
Once the tub was half full I turned it off , as I knew my body weight would displace the water and cause the level to rise once I got in . 
I sat down in the perfectly warm water and relaxed . 
Once the water started cooling down , I decided to go ahead and wash myself . 
I poured some bodywash on a cloth and washed from the top down . 
Then , I rinsed and drained the tub and dried off . 
That 's how I took a bath . 
I was looking in the mirror two weeks ago and thought my hair was getting too long , it looked scruffy and was getting difficult to style . 
I called my hairdresser and made an appointment to go and see her the following week to get a hair cut . 
It was difficult getting an appointment because she was very busy but I managed to get one . 
I drove to the hair salon where she works and parked the car . 
I walked inside and spoke to the lady on the reception desk to tell her who I was and who I was there to see , and she asked me to take a seat in the waiting area . 
There were lots of hair products on shelves around where I was sitting , and some hair style magazines on a table in front of the sofa I was sitting on . 
My stylist came through a door and greeted me and took me past people sitting on chairs in front of mirrors , all of them in various stages of having a hair cut . 
I sat down at my stylist 's usual chair and faced the mirror while she asked me what I wanted her to do . 
Sometimes when I go to see her I will have a picture of a style that I like that I have found on the internet or in a magazine but this time I just wanted her to keep it the same style but make it shorter . 
First of all she took me to an area with basins for washing hair and I had to sit with my back to it , with my head tilted back so my hair was in the basin . 
My stylist rolled up a towel and put it under the back of my neck to make the position more comfortable and washed my hair for me . 
After she was done she took me back to the chair and started to cut my hair , she pinned up sections of hair that she was n't working on and gradually let them down to cut them , eventually she had done all of it . 
She plugged in the hairdryer and sprayed some lotion onto my hair to make it easier to blow dry and proceeded to dry my hair until it was all dry and styled and shorter . 
When she was finished she held up a mirror for me so I could see the back of my hair . 
I was happy with it so I said goodbye and walked back to the lady on the reception desk to pay her for the hair cut . 
Planting a tree is a wonderful thing you can do for your community and your environment . 
Trees provide with life sustaining oxygen . 
They are also beautiful and we need them from , something to build a fort in , to wood to build our homes . 
Plant a tree by selecting the species you think would be best suited for the location and soil that you have . 
You then dig a hole that will keep the top of the rootball just slightly below ground level and the base of the tree just so it can have a shallow circle made around it . 
Fill in some fresh soil or even compost made from old rotting leaves and grass clippings . 
This will help fertilize the tree and if you want you can add some fertilizer . 
Cover it up and make a small ring around the base of the tree to help catch water . 
Then water the tree for a good long time so the roots will grow deep . 
We began by driving past the overloaded parking lot dreading finding a parking spot . 
Luckily we know of a spot on the side of the grocery store that is almost always vacant . 
My girlfriend and I park in our normal spot and walk inside . 
The store is booming with people and all the lines are full . 
We are the type of people who do not like a lot of people so we wanted to get in and out as fast as we could . 
Quickly we get all the groceries marked down on the list and we head to the checkout line . 
We found a shorter line that was for a lesser amount of groceries . 
Luckily we had 2 items less than the maximum for the line , so we hopped in and quickly got checked out and on our way . 
I carried the groceries out to the car rather than having the employees do it because there are much less able people who need there help more than I do . 
Finally we headed home and used our groceries to cook dinner . 
I wanted something interesting to read as I have several days with no plans starting this weekend . 
I enjoy various types of books but wanted something really different so I decided to go with a good science fiction and something that was rated well by reviewers . 
I found what I wanted online and drove to the library . 
I asked the librarian where the sci fi section was and showed me . 
Before looking for the one I wanted I browsed the books and saw several that looked interesting . 
I opened one in particular and starting going through it . 
I decided to select this book . 
I then looked for the book I came to borrow and eventually found it . 
Remarkably it had the same author as the previous book I had selected . 
I must have great taste in books . 
I brought both books to the front desk and checked them out . 
I was very pleased with the library and quite happy to have more than one book to look forward to reading . 
It first begins with turning on the heater in the bathroom for 10 minutes so that when I am waiting for the water to be warm I do not freeze . 
My parents and siblings think that this is weird but I do not care because it is my way of doing things . 
I look forward to a warm bath and enjoy getting clean and soaking afterwards to relax . 
Once the bath is full I slowly get in and feel the warmth wrap around my body . 
After getting comfy I close my eyes and relax for 10 or 15 minutes before beginning to get clean and proceed to get out . 
After cleaning I do not like to relax any longer because you are basically sitting in your dirt , grime , and filth . 
This is quite disgusting to think about and I would not ever recommend anyone to rest or relax in the filth . 
No matter how warm or cozy the water still seems . 
The other day , I had to catch a train from Los Angles to New York at the last minute . 
My boss wanted me to meet some foreign client in a brand new art gallery they recently bought in Manhattan . 
The boss called me at about 5:30 in the morning and told me that he already bought tickets to get from here to New York , but explained to me that he could n't make it as he had another meeting to that same morning . 
The tickets were for a train that departed at 7:15 am , so like a good worker bee , I got up , skipped showering , got dressed , and ran out the door with a dirty wrinkled suit I had n't had time to wash . 
The airport was 40 minutes away so I had very little time to spare . 
I managed to store my car and walk into the train station half asleep right at 7:10 am when I overheard my train was delayed over the intercom . 
When my train was called an hour later , I drowsily made my way on board where I got a window seat next to a larger fellow . 
I remember I was half asleep when I mumbled a hello to him . 
He happily greeted me back as I sat down . 
Right before the train took off and the trains stewardesses were telling us how to use our seat belts , I barely remember ending up falling asleep on the large man next to me . 
Four hours later , I got a nudge from the large man next to me telling me kindly to wake up and that our ride was over . 
I distinctly remember waking up with a mouthful of drool soaked on the large man ' s arm I feel asleep on and instantly apologized . 
He laughed and said to me Don ' t worry about it ! 
You looked so tired ! 
Would you believe this is n't the first time this has happened to me ? 
We both kind of laughed and went on our ways . 
It ended up being a great ride and sleep , overall . 
I get my hair cut by a person I met when my kids were in preschool with her kids . 
She is the best hair cutter I 've ever been to . 
She works at a nice salon , although she used to cut hair for cheaper out of her home . 
Now when I go to get a haircut , I call the salon to make an appointment . 
When I arrive at the salon , I check in with the receptionist and she asks whether I want to wear a tunic . 
-LRB- You can take off your top and wear one of their tunics if you want to be sure you do n't get hair on your top . -RRB- 
I used to , but now I do n't because the tunics are uncomfortable . 
Usually the receptionist asks whether I want a glass of lemon water or a cup of tea . 
I ask for lemon water . 
Then I sit down on one of the couches in the waiting area and read a fashion magazine and sip my water while I wait for my appointment time . 
The person who cuts my hair comes out to the waiting area to get me when it 's time . 
She puts a big plastic cape around my neck and washes my hair at a sink . 
She gives me a scalp massage , which always feels great . 
Then she wraps my head in a towel and we walk to her hair cutting station . 
I have to take my glasses off , so everything is very blurry . 
First I stand up behind the chair and she cuts the hair at the nape of my neck . 
Then I sit down and she cuts the rest . 
After the haircut , she blow-dries my hair gently and arranges the curls so that they look good . 
Then she gives me a hand mirror , and I put my glasses on to see what the haircut looks like . 
While I look at it , she sweeps up the hair from the floor . 
Then she walks me back out to the reception area , and I pay for the haircut . 
When I have a long day at work , I like to take a bath before I go to bed . 
Baths are very relaxing . 
They make me sleepy and feel nice . 
I start my bath by turning on the warm water faucet . 
Then I plug the drain so the water will stay in the tub . 
Sometimes I pour some bubble bath into the tub . 
When I do this , I pour a little bit of bubble bath liquid under the running water . 
Whenever the tub is about halfway full of water , I get in the tub and relax . 
Sometimes I read a book in the bathtub , and other times I simply sit there . 
When I am not reading , I often think about my day and what I will do tomorrow . 
After about 15 or 20 minutes , I decide to get out of the tub . 
I drain the water and bubbles , and my bath is over . 
After breakfast I got in my car and drove to the grocery store to buy food for the next several days . 
I like to walk so I parked in the back row of the parking lot . 
I walked in the store and selected a shopping cart that did n't have stuck wheels . 
As I normally do I first proceeded to the deli department and got a number . 
Since there were several people in front of me I started my shopping near the deli . 
I picked some fresh produce and vegetables until my number was called . 
At the deli I purchased ham , cheese and salami . 
I picked up a whole chicken and a steak , the steak would be for tonight the chicken for a few days . 
I picked up stuffing and gravy for the chicken . 
I browsed through the isles selecting various items that I did n't really need . 
As I proceeded to the checkout there was a sale isle which I picked up a few more items . 
I paid for my groceries and walked back to my car , placing the bags in the car and drove home . 
When I go grocery shopping it is usually pretty hectic . 
Right now I ca n't drive , so I have to find a ride there . 
I also have to make sure that I find someone who has a car that my two children will fit in as well . 
So , after finding a way to get there , I get a cart wiped down and put my youngest in the seat . 
Of course , if there happens to be a car cart , we have to take that one so both kids can sit inside . 
If I remembered to bring my list , I get all of the stuff on it first . 
I always grab other things as I see them and realize I need them . 
It can be a good thing , or a bad thing . 
We usually end up with quite a bit more than I intended , but since I ca n't go to the store whenever I want , I usually justify it to myself . 
So , we get into the check out line and of course I have to tell my oldest child we ca n't get every candy he sees in the aisle while we are waiting . 
After we check out , we go outside and I get the kiddos in first . 
Then to bring our shopping trip to an end , I puzzle piece everything into the back of our car and return the cart . 
I recently needed to go to a moderately distant city . 
Because it is on the other side of a local mountain range , travel in my car would be very hard on it , and I might get lost . 
Fortunately there is a passenger train that goes between out two cities . 
I had , before this trip , never been on any kind of train bigger than one at the amusement park . 
I was very excited for this opportunity . 
When I arrived at the station I was very pleased to see that the train had large windows . 
While on the trip these proved to be wonderful for all of the gorgeous views provided by nature . 
As my trip was a half day journey . 
I stopped in the dining car for lunch , I found it highly enjoyable to eat on the train , and this also helped to distract me from the time . 
When I arrived in the other city I met a friend who was eager to learn about my trip . 
Last week , my friend and I rode the public bus into town . 
We looked at a bus schedule and found the bus stop closest to our homes . 
We got to the bus stop ten minutes before our bus was supposed to arrive and waited . 
When it arrived , we got into the line to board . 
Each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the machine at the front of the bus . 
We had no token , so we gave the bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in . 
We found a seat at the back of the bus and sat down . 
We checked our bus schedule and decided where we wanted to get off . 
When the sign at the front of the bus showed that it was our stop , we gathered our things and prepared to get off . 
After we got off , we made a note of which bus stop we were at and the time the bus would be there again to take us home . 
Then we went off to explore the town . 
I took a bath for the first time in a long time last week . 
I wanted to be able to relax and get clean without all the work of standing up to shower ! 
First , I made sure the bathtub was cleaned out . 
I then ran the hot water first and filled up most of the bathtub . 
I turned the hot water off and then turned the cold on , that way the temperature of the water was not too hot and not too cold , but just right . 
I got a book that I had been wanting to read and climbed in . 
After reading for awhile , I decided that it was time to wash off since the water was starting to cool down . 
I washed off my face and body , and then used shampoo and conditioner in my hair . 
When I was all done , I drained the water from the tub and used the shower to rinse off . 
I dried myself off with a big towel and put on my pajamas so I would be comfortable . 
After making the decision to take a bath , I began to prepare . 
I started by getting out my bubble bath , several candles , and a book to read . 
I placed candles all around the perimeter of the tub and began to light them . 
After all the candles were lit , I started the tub 's water and adjusted it to the appropriate temperature that I wanted . 
I then placed the stopper in the drain and added a substantial amount of bubble bath to the water . 
After the tub was filled , I shut off the water and began to disrobe . 
After removing my clothing , I took hold of my book and settled in to the tub to soak and relax for awhile . 
I read my book until the water began to get cold . 
I then took a few minutes to make sure I was clean , scrubbing myself all over . 
After that was complete , I removed the stopper to drain the water , blew out the candles , and climbed out of the tub . 
I then toweled off and put on my bath robe . 
Last weekend , I got into my car to head to the grocery store . 
The store I normally go grocery shop at is Safeway , with the exception of the few times I go to SaveMart . 
But for this time , I headed to Safeway . 
I grabbed a shopping cart and immediately went to the left of the store like I normally do . 
I grabbed the bread items I needed along with any breakfast pastries I enjoy buying . 
Like normal , I skip the first four aisles due to them being for personal care and pet care . 
I buy my personal items elsewhere -LRB- such as shampoo , etc. -RRB- . 
I then went down the beverage aisle where I picked up several Gatorades and bottled waters . 
I then continue going up each aisle after the beverage one , where I would pick up my frozen foods , canned foods , snacks -LRB- such as chips and cookies -RRB- , and any other lunch items -LRB- frozen or non-frozen -RRB- . 
I then ended with the fruits and vegetables , where I picked up a bunch of bananas and about four apples . 
I took my cart to the lone open register after waiting for about five minutes . 
After purchasing my items , I went out to my car and packed my groceries into the trunk . 
Last year , I was outside working in the garden when I realized that my front yard would like much nicer if I planted a tree to provide it with a little shade . 
I went to the gardeners store down the street and pick up some seeds to plant my tree . 
I decided on a maple tree as that would look nice and make a perfect amount of shade for my front lawn . 
I dug a small hole where I wanted to plant the tree and put the seeds in place . 
Every few weeks I noticed that the tree started to grow more and more as I provided it with the correct amount of water and nutrients . 
After about 12 months the tree I had planted was nearly fully grown and looked wonderful next to me garden . 
I was very satisfied with the entire situation and love the idea of plants growing from the ground . 
'' Before you board the plane you should consider picking up a bottle of water and a snack in case they do n't have anything you 'd like to drink or eat on the flight . 
You should also stop at the restroom so , hopefully , you wo n't have to go to the bathroom during the flight . 
If you have an assigned seat for your flight do n't rush to get on because it 'll just mean sitting there for a longer period of time . 
Once you are ready to board just be patient with everyone else who is flying and with the flight attendants . 
Once you have found your seat store any large items overhead and keep whatever you might want during the flight in the seat-back . 
I suggest putting your electronic devices there , headphones , books etc. . 
I also like to make sure to have gum , my snack and my water readily available . 
If you have a smaller item you can put that underneath the seat in front of you . 
It is a good idea to chew gum at least at the start of the flight so you avoid having your ears pop . 
Try to stay hydrated during your flight , and keep your seat-belt on whenever you are sitting down . 
I was skimming my Nook for something good to read and found that I had either read everything or that I was not interested in what I had not read . 
So I decided to go to the local library and get one of the old fashioned paper books that I had not read . 
I went and looked around the shelves and talked to the librarian and other customers about what was good to read . 
After picking up a few and reading the summary I finally found one of interest and took it to the checkout line . 
While checking out the book the librarian noticed the handgun on my hip and we had a great conversation about the importance of being ready , willing , and able to protect yourself in any situation and in any locality . 
She said she was grateful to live in a Nation where we had that right and I heartily agreed with her . 
One weekend , my partner and I decided to take a weekday trip up to Seattle . 
We purchased tickets online immediately after a quick breakfast . 
After deciding what parts of Seattle to visit , we drove over to Amtrak station and parked in a spot allowed for the day . 
The boarding process was very simple , the train was also a lot cleaner than we thought ! 
We had grilled cheese sandwiches from a menu handed to us , they were delicious . 
It took barely a few hours to get there , so we decided to look out the window at the scenery most of the time . 
None of us became sick , which was another one of our worries . 
My partner suffers from light vertigo . 
The staff on the train were exceptionally nice , and offered us snacks on occasion . 
The train was a great idea for the trip we had planned . 
It was much nicer than driving up the interstate . 
Today I went to go get a haircut . 
I 've been waiting to get a haircut for a while but finally I decided it was time to get it . 
So I went over to the barbershop near my house . 
Once inside the barbershop I told the barber that I needed a haircut and took my seat util they called my name . 
Once they called my name I went and sat at the chair and the barber put a towel over me so that the hair that he cuts does n't get over my clothes . 
I tell him what kind of haircut I want and then he begins to cut my hair . 
He periodically asks me if he is doing a good job throughout the haircut to make sure that I am happy with the hair that he is cutting . 
I reassure him that he is doing a good job and after he is done he takes off the towel and I get a final look at my haircut . 
I nod my head , pay him for the haircut and also a tip and leave the barbershop after that . 
I have to take a shower afterwards for some hair that happened to get down the back of my shirt . 
If you have a flat tire it is quite easy to change it yourself . 
The front tire is the easiest to change while the back will require more time and maybe additional tools . 
This is usually the back tire is where the chain and gears are connected to so it is harder to take off the bike frame . 
Sadly , most of the time a flat tire is the back tire because the back tire supports most of your weight on a bicycle . 
So you 'll need a wrench to undo the bolts on both sides of the tire . 
This will allow you to take off the entire tire . 
Inside the tire is an innertube , and this is the part you either need to replace or patch up . 
If it is a small hole and you can easily find the hole , you can use a tire patch kit to fix the hole . 
Other wise you may just replace the entire innertube altogether . 
Either way you will put the innertube back , and then the tire back onto the bike frame . 
Lastly , screw back on the bolts and pump some air into the tire . 
You 'll be ready to ride soon after ! 
Yes going on a train , this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago . 
We purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City . 
As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . 
We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . 
Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . 
Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . 
The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . 
love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way . 
First I saw large suburban areas but as we got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted . 
It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere . 
Soon we approached NYC and the train came to slow stop , we had arrived at our destination . 
The ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long . 
My sister went to the library to borrow a book . 
She had a library card from the city library . 
She took her card with her . 
When she was inside the library , she sat in the front of the computer to check the catalog . 
She typed the name of the book that she was looking for . 
She got the number from the computer search results . 
She wrote down the number and looked through the books in the shelf . 
She found the book rather quickly . 
She made sure it was the one she was looking for . 
She then went to the front desk to check out the book . 
The staff in the library took her book and her library card . 
He scanned her card from the machine and printed out a note . 
It has the information of the book , when it was checked out and the date she needed to return to the library . 
The staff told her to return before the date to avoid any penalty . 
Do n't own a car ? 
Tired of walking around ? 
Well I have a perfect solution for you , and it 's right under your nose . 
Head to your local corner bus stop and travel on another form of transportation ! 
It 's very simple if you live in an Urban setting , and still pretty simple in the suburbs . 
A good resource first is to look up a bus schedule on the internet . 
Additionally , you could search the sidewalks for prominent signage that indicates a bus will stop in your area . 
Once you decide on where you want to go , and the time at which the bus comes , just head out to this stop and simply wait . 
A bus will eventually show up where you can board and pay directly to the bus driver . 
Once paid , simply find an open seat and gaze out the window at the bustling of life that you are passing by . 
Eventually you will arrive at your destination and can exit the bus . 
Once you finish running your errands simply return to another bus spot and find a ride home . 
I decided my backyard needed another tree . 
So I went to the tree nursery and picked out a tree that I liked . 
I rented a pickup truck to bring the tree home . 
I loaded the tree into the truck and drove it to my house . 
I grabbed a shovel from my garage , and I dug a hole in my backyard where I wanted the tree to go . 
I poured some special tree fertilizer into the hole that I had bought from the tree nursery . 
I then asked a friend to help me , because the tree was very big and heavy . 
Together we placed the tree in the hole . 
I then started to fill up the dirt around the tree . 
Halfway through filling it , I took a garden hose and poured water down the hole . 
When the water settled , I finished filling in the dirt . 
Over the dirt I placed a nice bed of mulch around the tree . 
I watered the tree once more , then stepped back to admire my work . 
I had to bake a cake for a birthday party . 
I took out the ingredients and put them on the counter : flour , sugar , eggs , vanilla , salt , baking soda , and milk . 
I then turned on the oven , setting it at 375 degrees . 
While it was preheating , I got to work . 
I mixed the wet ingredients together in a big bowl , and then slowly started adding the dry ingredients . 
I used a blender to stir the ingredients together . 
When they were all mixed together , the batter was ready . 
It was the consistence of thick maple syrup . 
I sprayed spray oil on the inside of a pan and then poured the cake batter into the pan . 
It was ready to go . 
When the oven beeped to let me know that it was finished preheating , I put the pan into the oven . 
I put on a timer for 12 minutes . 
When the timer went off , I opened the oven door and took the pan out . 
I inserted a toothpick into the center of the cake and took it out to see if the cake was done : the toothpick came out without any batter attached to it , so the cake was good to go . 
I turned off the oven and left the cake in the pan on the counter to cool . 
After a while I moved the cake to a cooling rack . 
When it was completely cool I covered it with chocolate frosting and wrote '' `` Happy Birthday ! '' '' 
on the top with a tube of blue icing . 
The cake looked great ! 
I needed a book about gardening . 
So I went to the nearby public library to see if they had a book that would be useful to me . 
I walked into the building and found the nonfiction section . 
I then sat at a computer and did a search for gardening books . 
Lots of books showed up on my search . 
I took a small pencil and piece of paper that were sitting next to the computer and wrote down several book titles with their call numbers next to them . 
I then looked at the shelves for the corresponding call numbers . 
When I found my section , I then looked for the exact numbers to find the books I had found on the computer search . 
I found the books and took them out of the shelf to get a better look . 
After browsing through them for a few minutes , I decided that I did want these books . 
I picked them up and walked over to the circulation desk . 
I handed the librarian my library card and the books I wanted to get . 
She checked them out for me , and told me when they were due . 
I then walked out of the library with my books . 
Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some books . 
All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I had to take the bus . 
First thing was to see what bus I needed . 
I went over to my computer and pulled up the bus schedules for my city . 
I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . 
There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . 
Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . 
I grabbed the books and headed out to walk to the bus stop . 
I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . 
It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . 
I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . 
It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . 
I got off the bus and went inside to return my books . 
It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all . 
My friend Adam and I decided to go to the flea market today because the weather was nice and we were hoping to take some random junk home with us . 
We walked around for a while , but nothing really caught our attention . 
We were looking for something special amount all this junk . 
Suddenly something caught my eye , it was an old Schwinn with a flat tire . 
The price was right so I decided to take it home with me . 
Fixing the flat tire was a trivial task , I could do it in my sleep . 
All I had to do was remove the brakes off the back wheel , then I needed to remove the wheel from the axle , next I would take the old tube off of the rim and replace it with the new one , lastly I would just put the tire back on the axle and reattach the brakes . 
With this little amount of effort I would have myself a brand new Schwinn . 
'' Today I baked a pound cake for . 
I opened my cookbook to the page with the cake recipe . 
I looked at the list of ingredients for the cake , and put them on the counter . 
I followed the recipe which told me to preheat the oven to 400 degrees . 
I needed eggs , butter , vanilla , salt , baking soda , flour , and sugar . 
I took out a large bowl , a medium bowl , measuring cups , and measuring spoons . 
In the large bowl , I put a stick of butter . 
I measured a cup of sugar into the same bowl . 
I used my electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar until they were creamy and fluffy . 
Then I added eggs and a teaspoon of vanilla and mixed them in . 
In the medium bowl , I measured flour , along with some salt and baking soda . 
I stirred the dry ingredients together . 
Next I poured the dry mixture into the wet mixture and stirred until everything was blended . 
I poured the cake batter into a loaf pan . 
Once the oven was preheated , I put the cake in . 
I baked it for 55 minutes . 
I put a toothpick in the center and took it out . 
The toothpick came out dry , so I took the cake out and put it on a rack to cool . 
I turned off the oven . 
Later I got to enjoy a slice of delicious pound cake , along with berries and cream . 
After a long day of playing sports outside and getting dirty in the mud and grass , I drove in my car to my home so I could take a nice warm bath and clean myself off . 
I opened the door and climbed the stairs so I could get into the bathroom . 
I turned on the faucet in the claw tub and watched the water run and fill up the tub . 
I added some of my favorite bubble bath mix to the hot water and watched in awe as the bubbles started filling the tub . 
I could not wait to get in . 
I undressed myself and put one foot in at a time into the warm tub . 
The water was quite hot , so I was careful not to get in too quickly and burn myself . 
As I got into the tub , I laid there and simply relaxed in peace . 
It felt so good . 
When I went on vacation last year with my parents , we took a trip on a train for part of it . 
We picked the route we wanted to take to go visit my uncle , and had everything ready the day before , such as our suitcases . 
When the day arrived for us to go , my dad drove us to the train station where we parked in a designated lot , since we would be returning to the same train station . 
We then headed to the train station and went inside where my dad purchased our tickets . 
We had some extra time , so we wandered around and found a little gift shop where we could buy souvenirs . 
When it was time to board our train , we walked through the station to get to the correct area . 
There were long hallways to get there , and then we went up a concrete pathway to where the train was outside . 
We had to give the ticket taker our tickets so she could verify we were getting on the right train . 
We all gathered in the train and found some seats that had n't been taken . 
We stored our luggage and prepared for the train to begin its journey . 
Once it was time to leave , we watched out the windows at all the passing scenery . 
After awhile , we all started doing our own thing like reading or playing cards to pass the time . 
It was a lot of fun and really neat to take a train trip . 
I entered the train depot and went up to the window . 
I asked for a ticket to Chicago . 
I paid for it and clerk gave me my ticket . 
The train was already boarding , so I went directly to the platform and boarded . 
I went down the aisle and found an empty seat . 
The train pulled out of the station . 
After a few minutes , the conductor came by and checked my ticket , punching it with a small hole punch . 
I looked out the window . 
People 's houses and huge warehouses passed by . 
Later , as we got into the country , I saw a cow or two . 
After about a half hour we pulled into the station in Chicago . 
The train pulled and stopped rather suddenly , throwing me forward a bit . 
I got up and went down the aisle and exited the train , stepping down to the platform and exiting the station . 
Windy City , here I come ! 
As I walked in through the sliding glass door I could feel my excitement rising up in my body . 
You see I had just entered the airport and this was my first time ever flying ! 
I went over to the self check in with my mom and typed in my ticket number and checked my bag . 
After receiving my tickets I went down to the dreaded security check point . 
To my surprise it was not as bad as I had thought . 
Even though the line was long it seemed to move quickly . 
I showed my ticket and ID to the agent and then kind of followed what everyone else was doing . 
I grabbed a bin and took off my shoes and put my book bag on the rolling belt as well . 
I emptied all my pockets and walked through the metal detector . 
To my surprise it did not beep , but my mom was not so lucky . 
She had to get waved by that wand thing and they discovered it was her belt buckle setting it off . 
After we grabbed our things and I got a book to read on the flight from a newsstand in the airport . 
We found our gate and they called us in groups . 
We got in line and handed the attendant our tickets and boarded the plane . 
I got the window seat and was super excited of getting to see out the window . 
The woman gave us the safety demo and we were off ! 
I was a little nervous on take off but after that it was smooth sailing . 
Two Diet Cokes and three hours later we arrived in Chicago ! 
I often use the public bus system locally to get around town , as it is much cheaper than driving . 
Before I leave home , I always make sure that I have enough money to pay for riding the bus wherever I need to go that day and back home . 
This is especially important if I am going to be buying anything else that day . 
Some bus systems have a special price for certain groups , like students . 
I am able to use my student ID card to get a discounted rate . 
I have a bus schedule at home where I can easily check it , but I have it memorized because I use it so much . 
I make sure I leave to go to the bus stop so that I get there about five minutes early . 
Usually the bus is on time , as long as there have n't been any issues that day . 
When the bus arrives , I first check that it is the bus number for where I want to go , as different bus lines go to different areas of the city . 
When I get on the bus , I have to show my ID and pay , and then I can go to a seat . 
Sometimes the bus can be pretty full , and I have to sit next to someone else . 
A lot of the same people will often ride the bus with me , so I get to know them . 
I will sometimes bring a book with me to read while I ride the bus . 
I make sure to pay attention to what stop we are at , and start to prepare one stop ahead of where I need to get off the bus . 
Once I arrive at my bus stop , I walk to the front of the bus and thank the driver , then hop off and continue with whatever I need to do that day . 
My family and I wanted to take a trip via train across the country . 
I called a travel agent to set up a time to meet with them and discuss the necessary arrangements . 
A few days later the appointment arrived and I went to the travel agent 's office to meet with them . 
After discussing our travel plans we decided that getting a private room on a sleeper car for the family would be the best option . 
I purchased the tickets and then went home to tell the family we were going and to pack . 
A week later we arrived at the train station an hour before boarding time to make sure that we did not miss the train . 
Once it was time we boarded the train and found our room . 
We stowed our luggage and discovered how the beds worked . 
Later it was time to eat and we went to the dining car at our scheduled time far dinner . 
After which we went back to our room where we did some talking before finally falling asleep . 
When we woke up we were only an hour from our destination . 
We had enough time to get changed and pack our things up and before we knew it we were getting off the train . 
It was a very pleasurable experience . 
In a few weeks , places around the world will be celebrating Earth Day , a global event promoting environment protection . 
I will , as I do every year , meet up with some friends who live close by and spend the day at the park . 
We will have a picnic , eat some food and drink a few beers , play frisbee and toss around a football and at some point , we will plant trees off to the side of the park . 
We will plant these trees in an effort to promote environmental sustainability , and to do our part as one in a millions ' chance to help the environment . 
Damage is being caused to the environment and local ecosystems at an alarming rate and we should all join together to do what we can in promoting awareness and getting the word out that we need to change our ways to help protect our environment . 
Planting a tree is my small contribution . 
Last month I went on a trip to Mexico . 
I was excited because I had never been to Mexico or flown on a plane before and I was going to get to do both . 
I booked my flight months in advance to be sure I would have transportation to my vacation destination . 
The day I was about to leave I went to the airport hours in advance because I was nervous and excited . 
I checked in at the correct terminal where the flight was supposed to leave from . 
A nice lady checked my ticket and confirmed that my flight was on schedule . 
I then proceeded to the security check station where officers checked my bags and personal belongings . 
After the quick screening and a short wait my plane boarded . 
I found my seat next to the window and was full of excitement . 
After some short instructions the plane taxied the runway and then sped up in a flash . 
I watched as the tires left the ground and we took to the sky . 
After several hours in the air the plane descended and touched down on a runway in Mexico . 
I was excited to get my vacation started . 
I had just finished eating my lunch and knew it was time to go grocery shopping for the week . 
I always buy my groceries all at one time for the week and then cook everything over the weekend so that I do n't have to cook on a daily basis . 
Anyway , I hopped in my car and drove to Walmart which is where I usually do all my grocery shopping . 
I found a parking space close to the entrance because I knew I was going to buy a lot . 
I got out of the car , walked through the store doors , and grabbed a shopping cart along the way . 
I made my way down the fruit and vegetable aisles first , picking up bananas , oranges , salad mix , and kale along the way . 
I then added some fish , chicken , hamburger meat , and pork to my cart . 
Moving along down the aisles , I picked up all the dairy goods , spices , and snacks I would need for the week . 
With my cart stacked high , I headed to the check out line where the cashier greeted me warmly and began ringing my items up . 
My total came to $ 101.43 which was a lot of money but definitely worth it . 
The cashier bagged my groceries as I paid . 
Then , I pushed my cart full of groceries out of the store and to the parking lot where I would load them into my trunk . 
I put the cart in the cart holding area and drove away . 
Friday was Madison 's birthday party and I wanted to make sure that I looked my best . 
I asked my dad to take me to the local barber shop . 
When I got there , I sat down and saw that there were two other people waiting . 
I decided to go over to the magazine rack and I found a magazine about baseball . 
I really enjoyed all of the stories that were in the magazine . 
Before I knew it , the barber called me over to the chair . 
I sat down and then he asked me what kind of haircut I wanted . 
It was summer so I decided to get a crew cut . 
He started off by using the electric razor on my head . 
After that , he got out the scissors in order to cut some of the remaining hair . 
After he finished , he put some powder on my face and brushed off any hair that had fallen . 
He showed me the haircut in a mirror and I was pleased . 
As I was riding home from school one day the worst possible thing that could happen did happen . 
My tire popped . 
I knew I was in deep because I had no idea how to repair a flat bicycle tire . 
Luckily my grandfather did and with his advice we went to get a new tube for the rims of my bike 's tire . 
We arrive at the store and I am swamped . 
There are so many different kinds and sizes of tubes . 
Well luckily my grandfather had already looked before we had left and knew which kind we needed . 
With that in mind we purchased the one we needed and returned home ready to go . 
My grandfather showed me that to repair a tire you need to take off the old broken tube and the replace it with the new one . 
After that you take a pump and pump air into the tire until it is full . 
I was n't prepared last time for my tire to pop but you can be sure that I will be the next 
I began by finding the culprit of my flat tire , it was a nail on the side of the road . 
Unfortunately I did not have a spare tire so I had to carry my bike the rest of the way home . 
After the gruesome trek back to my house I flipped the bicycle upside down and began my repair . 
First I took off the outer tire to replace my tube with a better more expensive tube that has the ability to fix a puncture . 
I do not want to experience carrying my bike a mile ever again . 
After putting the new tube on I screw back on the tire and put the outer tire over the tube . 
I then fill the PSI to 170 in my tire and listen for any leaking air . 
Then I spin the tire to make all the slime inside become evenly distributed throughout . 
This will prevent leaks in the future and even with a slight leak I will still be able to ride back home and fix the tire quickly yet again . 
Yesterday was my sisters birthday so I decided to bake a cake for her . 
I looked up the recipe for a chocolate cake in my cooking book . 
Chocolate cake is my sisters favorite kind of cake . 
I looked at the list of ingredients and checked my cupboards to make sure I had them all . 
I did . 
I preheated the oven as instructed by the recipe . 
I weighed the ingredients with the weighing scales . 
I cracked two eggs into the mixing bowl . 
I then poured the rest of the ingredients into the bowl . 
I mixed the ingredients for 5 minutes with an electric mixer . 
I poured the mixed ingredients into a cake tin and placed it in the oven . 
After 20 minutes the cake was finished and I removed it from the oven . 
I let it cool down for a few minutes while I made some icing . 
I poured the icing over the cooled down cake and decorated the cake with some edible glitter . 
As I was bring my bike out of the garage I realized the rear tire had flat and there was clearly a small hissing sound where there was a puncture . 
I got my tools and loosened and removed the nuts holding the tire on the bike . 
Using a screwdriver I wedged underneath the tire removing it from the metal wheel . 
I removed the tire tube and cleaned off the punctured area with a dry cloth . 
I put tire repair glue on the hole and placed a tire patch on the glue and held it tight for several minutes until the glue dried . 
I filled it up to ensure the hole was not leaking any air . 
I put the tube back in the tire and re-attached it to the wheel tightening the bolts . 
Again I filled the tire with air and took my bike for a ride . 
I was successful repairing my flat tire . 
It was the day before my girlfriend 's birthday and I decided to do something special for her ! 
Her favorite flavor is strawberry so I will make her a strawberry cake as a surprise . 
I began by getting the best strawberries and most delicious cake batter from the store I could find . 
When I arrived home I turned on the oven and began to make the batter . 
I mix the ingredients together and put the cake together . 
It then goes in the oven to bake and become golden and perfect for eating . 
I take the cake out after it has baked and put sprinkles on top and place the candles . 
I write on the cake happy birthday princess ! 
! 
The next day I surprise her with the best cake that she has ever seen . 
She is so surprised that she faints ! 
After waking back up she enjoys the cake and tells me it is the best that she has had in years . 
Today is Arbor Day and I am going to plant a tree to celebrate . 
My mother bought an apple tree at the plant store for me . 
She helped me carry it outside to plant . 
I had to pick the perfect spot for my tree . 
I decided it would look really nice over by the swing set . 
I picked a spot far enough away that the apples would n't fall on my swing set , though . 
I got a shovel and dug a really deep hole . 
It took me a long time ! 
Then my mom helped me put a little bit of fertilizer in the hole . 
Fertilizer helps the tree grow . 
The next thing I did was put the bottom of the tree into the hole and cover the root ball up with dirt . 
Finally , I took the water hose and sprayed the dirt around the bottom of the tree with water . 
I ca n't wait to see my new tree grow bigger and bigger ! 
I live in an area with good train and bus coverage . 
I typically choose the train as it is more predictable but for some parts of the city that the train can not reach , I will take the bus . 
The bus stations are typically outdoors so depending on where I 'm going I 'll head to the nearest bus stop . 
There 's an app that shoes when the next bus is coming so I 'll take out my phone to see how long the wait is . 
Typically the wait is about 10-15 minutes . 
Once the bus arrives , I take out my transit card to tap on the machine that collects the fare . 
This is done at the very beginning at the entrance of the bus . 
Once I hear the beep notifying me that the fare has been collected I will take a seat upstairs if it 's a double decker bus . 
The view is much better from the top and there are usually seats at the top . 
Now it 's time to sit back and enjoy the ride and get off at my destination . 
Traveling by train can be very convenient and\/or relaxing . 
Some trains , like commuter trains , can get you into a city without having to rely on cars or walking . 
This is very quick , affordable , and convenient ! 
You simply hop on the train at your stop and hop off when you need to . 
Most commuter trains offer passes that are a great discount for people who ride it often . 
Other trains travel long distances . 
Perhaps you do n't like to fly or do n't want to drive your car a long distance . 
If you ride a train , you can see the beautiful scenery as you travel but you are free to walk around , read , chat , or even grab a bite to eat ! 
Some trains also have sleeper cars so travelers can be well-rested when they arrive at their destination . 
There are many conveniences to going on a train that make it a great option for getting from point A to point B ! 
Last week I went to Ireland to visit my family . 
I rode the bus to the airport . 
At the airport I checked in my luggage and went through security . 
After going through security I headed towards the departure gate . 
I waited at the gate for about 30minutes and then people started to board . 
The airline woman checked my ticket and passport and I got on the plane . 
Before the plane took off the air hostesses gave a quick security briefing . 
On the plane I sat beside a nice old man . 
We talked about what we were going to do in Ireland . 
He said that he wanted to meet new friends and visit the popular tourist spots . 
After about an hour the air hostess brought me some refreshments . 
They were tasty . 
After 2 hours we landed at our destination . 
I exited the plane and collected my suitcase . 
I walked through the exit doors and saw my family waiting for me outside . 
I really enjoyed my trip home . 
My car is in the repair shop so I had to take the bus to work yesterday . 
The first thing I did was walk to the bus stop at the corner and then waited for the bus to arrive . 
I watched the signs on the front of the buses as they approached so I would know which one to take . 
When I saw the right one , I stood up so the driver would know I want to ride . 
The bus stopped and then the door opened . 
I climbed the steps and the bus driver said hello . 
You can buy a bus pass if you ride the bus a lot , but I do n't so I do n't have a pass . 
Instead , I put coins into the money receiver beside the bus driver and then I walked to where the seats are . 
The bus was only about half full , so I chose a seat by myself and sat down by the window . 
Once the bus started again , there was a little jerking motion as it moved forward and then we were rolling down the street . 
While I was sitting , I did n't touch anything in case it was dirty . 
Instead , I kept my hands in my lap and watched people , cars and buildings out of the window . 
A nice lady in the seat across from me smiled at me , but no one else paid attention to me and when the bus stopped I got up along with several other people and climbed down to the street again . 
Baking a cake is so much fun . 
I always love to buy the package from the grocery store since this is the easiest way . 
You just need to mix the package with some eggs and oil . 
First I would pre-heat the oven to about four hundred degrees . 
Then mix all the cake batter ingredients all together until the consistency of the cake mix is smooth and there are no chunks . 
Then I slowly pour the batter into a cake pan and ensure that the batter is even in the pan . 
Sometimes I use cooking spray to oil the pan and sometimes I forget but honestly I feel like it does not make that big of a difference . 
Then I cook the cake and wait until it is done . 
Sometimes I like to look through the window on the oven door and watch how the cake will rise in the cake pan . 
Then I love to smell the cake as the aroma fills the entire house , oh I love this part so much . 
Then the timer beeps and I am so happy . 
The most important part of baking a cake , as my mother always told me , is to turn off the oven when the cake is doing baking . 
I pull it out and use a toothpick to make sure that the cake is done by making sure that the toothpick comes out clean from the middle of the cake . 
Then I wait a while and then I mix together some frosting . 
I spread the frosting on the cake and cut myself a piece and I eat it ! 
It tastes so amazing ! 
! 
I love cherries . 
I thought it would nice if I had a cherry tree in my backyard . 
There was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so I decided to plant one . 
I drove my pickup truck to a nursery near where I live . 
They had many different types of trees there , all growing in large pots . 
The trees were very skinny , but I knew once they were out of the pots and planted in the ground , they would grow into large trees . 
I found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost . 
I asked a man who worked at the nursery if he would put the tree in my pickup after I paid for it . 
I went to the cashier and paid for the tree and the man loaded it into my truck . 
When I got home , I got a shovel and dug a huge hole where I wanted the tree to grow . 
I made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole . 
I added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need . 
In the middle of the hole I made the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone . 
I took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot . 
I stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it . 
This would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily . 
I replaced the dirt , making sure the tree was even with the ground around the hole . 
When the hole was all filled up I stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil . 
When I was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move , I got my garden hose . 
I turned on the water and slowly watered the tree . 
After a few hours , I watered it again . 
When all the water had sunk into the ground , I put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing . 
I knew that I would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established . 
The tree will get bigger every year , and I 'm looking forward to the day when I 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard ! 
Weekly grocery shopping begins at the local supermarket down the street . 
It 's the closest by with a great selection . 
It may not be the cheapest but nothing compares in how close it is . 
Once I am at the store , I usually head straight to the fruits and vegetable sections first . 
I will grab all the fruits and veggies that I think I will need for the week . 
I do n't really go with a shopping list or anything in mind . 
Usually whatever looks the freshest or is on sale is what I tend to buy . 
After selecting these items , I will move to the proteins . 
Sometimes it is chicken and sometimes it beef . 
It depends on the vegetables I 've just selected to determine which type of protein I will be purchasing . 
Lastly , once those are done I will pick up the packaged goods such as milk , bread , eggs , and cereal . 
I do n't each much junk food or processed foods so this is basically all I will get for a typical trip to the grocery store . 
Just the other day I baked a cake . 
I found a recipe online for a chocolate cake that I really wanted to try , so I went to the store and bought all the ingredients . 
Then I went home and put everything out onto the counter , including my mixing bowls , measuring cups , and baking dish . 
The first thing I did was to mix the flour , water , sugar , butter , eggs and chocolate together in my big mixing bowl . 
I then greased up my baking dish with oil , so the cake would n't stick to it while it was baking . 
Then I set the oven temperature to 350 degrees and let it preheat . 
After all my ingredients were in the bowl , I used a big spoon to stir everything together until it was nice and mixed up . 
Then I poured the batter into my baking dish , and put it into the oven . 
I let it bake for an hour , then took out the cake and let it cool . 
After it was cool I put icing on it , and cut it into pieces to save for later . 
Then I cleaned up my huge mess . 
I prefer a shower over a bath , but when I need to take a bath it 's to relax from a stressful evening . 
Taking a bath requires filling the whole tub up with warm water . 
This may take some time and I will have to be sure to have a stopper to prevent the water from draining away from the tub . 
While the water is filling up , I will add the bubble bath solution to make the water soapy and fragrant . 
The aroma in the bath is what de-stresses me . 
Usually it 'll be a nice lavender smell or something not too strong but is very pleasant to smell . 
Once the tub is filled , I will slowly enter myself into the water . 
This can be tough at first because the water is usually too hot in the beginning so I will ease myself in . 
But once in , the bath will really work to help get the blood circulating to get a nice feeling of relaxation . 
I will typically stay in until the water is no longer warm or the bubbles have gone away . 
So when the water is just lukewarm , I will drain the tub and then rinse off using the normal shower . 
There is a bus stop down the street from my house . 
If you take it going south , it leads to the city , and if you take it going north , it leads to the next suburban town . 
I needed to go to the city , so I went to the bus stop and waited . 
I waited about ten minutes and then the bus came . 
It wheezed to a stop near me and then the door opened . 
I walked into the bus and up the short flight of stairs toward the driver . 
I had just enough change on me to pay the fare . 
I fed my coins into the slot where you put your money and then walked to the left and down the aisle to find my seat . 
I passed the front seats , which are intended for older or handicapped passengers , and took a seat about halfway down the bus , next to the window . 
The bus ride lasted 15 minutes . 
When I saw that my stop would be next , I pulled the yellow cord that runs along the side of the bus . 
That makes a beep and signals the driver that someone wants to get off the bus . 
The beep sounded and the bus driver pulled over to the side of the road at the next bus stop . 
The doors opened . 
I got up and went to the rear door of the bus , walked down the stairs , and walked out onto the sidewalk . 
I needed a hair cut one day . 
It had been quite a while since my last cut , and the ends of my hair were starting to look uneven and ragged . 
While I was driving one day , I found a sign for a haircut for only $ 5 . 
What a great deal ! 
I decided to go ahead and stop in for a quick trim . 
I went inside and signed my name on the waiting list . 
I found a chair to sit in and looked around . 
There were a lot of people there ! 
It must have been because of the great deal on the hair cut . 
Because it was busy , I had to wait a while , but eventually my name was called . 
I told the beautician I had my hair cut not that long before and just wanted my ends to be cleaned up so my hair looked better . 
She put a cape around my shoulders and took me to wash my hair . 
After washing my hair , she cut off a half of an inch and used a blow dryer . 
I paid for my haircut , left a tip for the beautician , and left the salon feeling light and beautiful . 
It was the summertime and my hair was getting quite long , as it was down to nearly my bellybutton . 
As a result , I decided it was time for a haircut . 
After flipping through numerous options , I decided to get a bob hair cut to my chin . 
This was a drastic change , yet I knew I was ready for it . 
I left the house and took the drive over to the salon . 
My favorite hairstylist Michelle eagerly greeted me with an excited smile . '' 
`` You ready for this ? '' '' 
She asked me . '' 
`` Yes ! 
Definitely ! '' '' 
I exclaimed . 
Michelle led me over to a sink as she washed my hair with sweet smelling shampoo . 
After towel-drying my hair quickly , she led me over to her salon chair . 
She took out her scissors and started cutting . 
I looked down at the floor at all the hair that flying all over the place . 
I started to get nervous , wondering if I made a mistake . 
By the time she was done cutting and blew dry my hair , I looked back in the mirror . 
It looked amazing ! 
To get to work everyday I take the bus . 
I always get to the bus stop early to wait for it to arrive . 
Once it comes I board and swipe my metro card to pay . 
If I do n't have my card I have to feed money into the machine which always stressed me out for some reason . 
Then I choose a seat if one is available . 
If not I stand . 
If I see someone who is elderly or pregnant I always give them my seat . 
Sometimes crazy people are on the bus as well . 
There is nothing to be done but avoid them and hope they do n't bother you . 
The bus stops and starts a lot and passenger board and depart . 
When I get to my stop I pull the cord at the top of the bus so the driver knows to stop . 
Once we stop I depart the bus and continue on my journey .
