My daughters birthday is today and She wants a pineapple upside down cake . 
I have all the ingredients and I gather them according to the recipe and place them on the counter . 
I like having everything together before hand . 
The cake needs to bake at 350 degrees , so I turned the oven on to preheat so it is at the right temperature when I am done mixing the cake , The recipes say to put all the wet ingredient into the mixer first and mix well . 
Then all the dry ingredients go in and mix for 3 minutes . 
The mixture is now a thick batter that I can pour into cake pans that have been greased with shortening or butter and coated with a bit of flour so the cake does not stick . 
I place the brown sugar and pineapple in the bottom of the pan and split the batter equally between the two pans and put them into the oven . 
A short time late the cakes are done and I take them out to cool , when I turn the over I can see the pineapple is baked into the top of the cake . 
I know she will love it ! 
Today I decided to bake a cake for my daughter 's birthday . 
I knew she would want a chocolate cake , so I went to the store to purchase ingredients . 
I bought cake mix and frosting , as well as ingredients necessary to make the cake such as eggs and oil . 
I came home and made sure that my kitchen was clean and ready to bake in . 
I set the oven to preheat and went about mixing up the cake batter . 
While the oven was preheating , I greased and floured a cake pan and dumped the batter into it . 
Finally , the oven beeped which signaled that it was ready . 
I placed the cake on the middle rack in the oven and shut the oven door . 
I checked the back of the cake mix box to see timing instructions for the pan size I chose , and set the built-in timer on my oven accordingly . 
While the cake was baking , I cleaned up my mess . 
I wiped down the counters , put the mixer away , and loaded the dishwasher . 
Once the timer went off , I removed the cake from the oven and set it aside to cool . 
Once it was cool , I frosted and decorated it . 
That 's how I baked my cake . 
I went to the library to borrow a book I needed for a research paper . 
I went inside the library and went to the section that contained the type of books I needed to do my research on . 
After finding the right section , I looked through the selections of books they had . 
I quicly looked through a few of the books to see what type of information they had . 
After finding the book I wanted to borrow I took it to the counter so I could check it out and borrow it for a few days . 
At the counter , the librarian asked for my library card . 
I took the library card out of my wallet and gave it to her . 
She collected my information and gave me the book and my library card . 
I then exited the library and took the book home . 
I am glad I had the library card because the book was really useful for helping me do my research paper . 
As I was getting ready for work this morning , I noticed in the mirror that my hair was getting a bit longer than I 'd like . 
I resolved to go get a haircut after work . 
While I was at work , I researched salons . 
I decided on one while I was at lunch , and called to make an appointment for 5 pm . 
I got there about 15 minutes early , and informed the receptionist that I had an appointment . 
She welcomed me and asked me to have a seat . 
I saw and perused a few magazines and hairstyle books while I waited , and actually found a style I liked more than what I had already had in mind . 
Once the stylist was done with her previous client , she came to greet me . 
She asked what I wanted and I presented the picture I found . 
She said that was no problem , and took me back to the styling chair . 
She washed and conditioned my hair and put a cape on me . 
She confirmed with me again what I wanted , and set off to cutting . 
I sat as tiny bits of hair fell all around me . 
Once she was done , she blow dried and styled my hair . 
It looked just like the picture . 
That 's how I got a hair cut . 
I woke up this morning and decided to go get my haircut . 
I normally go to a place that calls for a phone call in advance of arriving but this time I decided to go to a different place where I could just walk in . 
When I arrived I had to wait for about 10 minutes before someone could cut my hair , which was alright with me since I did not make an appointment or anything . 
When I got in the chair the lady cutting my hair asked me what kind of haircut I wanted and I told her short hair on the top with a buzz cut on the sides . 
She told me that would be a great look for me and I agreed . 
During the hair cut I talked to the barber about what I did in life and asked her some questions as well . 
After about 10 minutes she finished the job . 
I tipped her 5 dollars for her effort and went off satisfied with my haircut . 
It was a good experience . 
I traveled by train to a visit a friend who lived a few hours from me . 
I planned to stay overnight , so I packed a suitcase to take with me . 
When I arrived at the train station , I went to the ticket counter to purchase a ticket . 
I looked at the schedule of departing trains and selected the time I wanted to leave . 
I paid for my ticket and waited . 
After a while , it was time for my train to depart . 
I went to the front of the train with other passengers . 
I carried my small suitcase with me . 
The conductor took my ticket , stamped it , and handed it back . 
I found a nice seat by the window and settled in for the ride . 
When everyone was aboard , the train announcer announced that we 'd be leaving the station . 
He announced where we were leaving from , and the final destination . 
I brought a book with me to read , and some snacks in case I got hungry . 
As the train traveled , I watched the scenery that went by - there were small houses and fields with cows . 
I enjoyed seeing places I had n't seen before . 
After a few hours I arrived . 
My friend picked me up at the station and we drove away in her car . 
My husband was riding down a steep hill a few miles from home when he got a blow out . 
He called me to come and get him . 
Luckily he was n't hurt . 
He had the bicycle repair kit on him . 
We took the tire off with some tools . 
We took the inner tube out . 
He checked the inner tube for holes by putting air in it . 
He found the hole and marked it . 
That is the place where he put the patch and glued it . 
My husband put the tube back in the bicycle . 
The frame was a little bent but the bike was okay . 
I followed him for a little while . 
He was almost to the park so I met him there . 
After a while we put the bike in the back of the truck and drove home . 
It had been close to a year since my last trim . 
I usually make sure I 'm clean if I plan to go to a hairdresser . 
I jumped in the shower and quickly lathered up . 
My hair was pretty clean to begin with , but I wanted to make sure I was clean for sure . 
The haircut place takes walk-in appointments , and I waited barely 5 minutes to be seated in a chair . 
The attendant was especially nice , and asked how I was , and how I wanted my hair to be done . 
In the summer I usually keep it quite short , so I asked for most of it to be trimmed off . 
I asked the hairdresser to go forward with what they thought was best . 
I usually ask this because they are trained to judge what appearances would work best for certain people . 
Overall , it took 15 minutes for the haircut to finish . 
After a quick dusting off , I was on my way home with a fresh look . 
Getting a hair cut is not always fun but it has to be done regularly if you want to control your hair and not look shaggy and mangy . 
First pick a good barber or stylist that you think does a good job and stick with them . 
In time they will get to know your hair and needs and will consistantly cut your hair to your liking . 
Do n't be afraid to look at pictures of models or whatever to see styles you like and then ask the stylist to try to cut your hair like that . 
And always sit still so as they cut your hair they dont slip and mess up a cut . 
Then let them show your full cut from front to back with a mirror you hold up and look into the other mirror . 
After they take your hair cover thing then give them their money and a few extra dollars for a tip . 
I love reading books , and once I finished all my books in the library , I decided that I needed new books . 
The best place in my neighborhood for getting new books for free was the local library . 
To borrow from the library , all you needed was a simple library card . 
I walked to the local library and went to my favorite section of the library . 
The history section had my favorite books about Napoleon . 
Once I found my favorite book , I took it with me and brought it over to the check outline . 
I waited in line until it was my turn . 
I gave the librarian my book and library card and they checked it out for me . 
I was given a receipt and a date to return the book . 
I had three weeks to finish the book before I had to go back and return it . 
When I left the library , the security checked my receipt and my books and allowed me to leave . 
My wife and I were flying to New York City for a vacation . 
We both like to fly . 
After going through the preliminaries and waiting in the lounge , we were soon stepping onto the plane and trying to find our seats . 
Planes can be crowded when one is getting on or off , but we found our seats and buckled in . 
It took a bit of time for everyone to settle in , but before long the plane was taxiing down the runway . 
When the plane lifted off , I could feel it tilt to one side and then right itself again . 
It was fun looking out of the window and seeing the world below get smaller and smaller , then disappear as we climbed above the clouds . 
We both enjoyed the plane ride a great deal . 
A flight attendant offered us drinks and snacks , and we had some orange soda and complimentary peanuts . 
Soon the flight was over , and it was time to disembark . 
We had enjoyed the airplane ride . 
Last year I had extra vacation days which if not used would not have carried over to this year . 
So in early Novermber , I started planning for a vacation and decided to go to New York . 
I purchased airline tickets for my family from a airline 's website . 
It was for 2 weeks starting from December 7th to 22nd . 
On 7th evening , we reached at the airport almost 3 hours before the flight 's departure . 
At the check in counter , I presented my driving license and ticket . 
The person at the counter verified my name and ticket and after security check , we got into the plane . 
I was at the window seat , so I could see the outside pretty well . 
Before take off , flight attendants asked us to put on seat belts . 
It took almost 2 hours for us to reach New York . 
Overall it was a nice flight and we reached there on time . 
A few weeks ago , I flew from Indianapolis to New York . 
When I arrived at the airport , I had with me one suitcase and my purse , and I made sure that my driver 's license and airplane ticket were handy in my purse . 
At the airport , I parked in the parking garage and made a note about where my car was so that I could find it when I returned . 
Then I walked across the bridge from the parking garage to the airport terminal , where I went to the check-in desk for my airline , Delta . 
At the check-in desk , I gave my driver 's license and my plane ticket to the clerk , who checked them to make sure I was who I said I was . 
She took my suitcase and gave me a claim ticket so that I could get it back when I got to New York . 
Then I went to security , where I had to put my purse and coat and shoes into pins that would go through an x-ray machine while I walked through a metal detector . 
On the other side of the metal detector , I collected my belongings and then found the gate -LRB- that is , the area where my particular plane would be loading up -RRB- . 
I sat in a waiting area at the gate until the airport attendant told us it was time to board the plane . 
While I was waiting , I used my cell phone to let my husband know I had gotten to the airport safely , then I read a book for a while . 
When they called us to board the plane , I got in line and we walked down a long ramp to get onto the plane . 
On the plane , we walked back to our assigned seats . 
I had a seat next to the window . 
It was very sunny , so I pulled down the shade on the window . 
The person sitting next to me said she was going to sleep and that I should wake her up if she snored . 
In a few minutes , the plane started taxiing , that is , driving around on the ground to get up speed . 
Then we took off and climbed up through the clouds . 
Once the plane was above the clouds , I mostly looked out the window , because I always enjoy looking at the clouds from above and catching occasional glimpses of the ground below . 
During the flight , the attendants brought us drinks , so I enjoyed a cup of coffee . 
The person next to me did snore a little , but it did n't bother me , so I did n't wake her up . 
After about an hour and 15 minutes , we landed in New York . 
Baking a cake either for myself or for friends is a fun activity . 
I first plan ahead , so I know what kind of cake I will be making and what supplies I will need for that cake . 
I prepare my pans , so the cake wo n't stick to the sides or bottom and preheat my oven so that when my batter is mixed it can go right into the oven . 
A simple cake will usually require eggs , flower , baking powder and a few other things . 
Generally speaking I will mix the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry in another before mixing them together . 
I like to use an industrial strength mixing bowl , as opposed to a hand mixer . 
I make sure that it is well mixed with no lumps , but not overly mixed , as that can ruin the batter . 
Once the batter is smooth and yummy I pour it into the prepared pans and pop them in the over for about 20-30 minutes . 
While the actually baking takes place , I can prepare the frosting . 
I love too cook . 
Cooking is far easier than most people think , in fact , I believe that it is often as easy to make good food from scratch as it is to make something from a box , and it tastes a million times better . 
One of the best examples of this is a simple cake . 
A basic yellow cake takes only a few ingredients ; flour , sugar , eggs milk , baking powder , salt , vanilla , and water . 
Once a person sifts the dry ingredients together it is the same a making a box cake mix . 
The time and directions are nearly identical , but the result is much cheaper and more delicious than anything out of a box . 
While the cake is baking it is wise to make a good frosting for the cake , once someone has home made frosting , the stuff in a can tastes only like chemicals . 
Frosting is even easier than the cake to prepare , Vanilla butter cream frosting the just ; powdered sugar , vanilla , butter and milk . 
When mixed in the correct proportions and whipped up this is the perfect topping for any cake , and with food coloring is an excellent medium for any decorated cakes , because any color will take easily to the stark white base . 
Once the cake is baked it is important to watch it , to be sure it cools enough before removing it from the pan to frost . 
A cake plate -LRB- the kind on a small pedestal -RRB- is the perfect thing to make guests fawn over this quick and easy dessert . 
It 's spring time so I decided to plant a tree . 
I purchased a small orange tree to go in the back yard . 
First I dug a hole where I wanted the tree . 
Then I shook the roots of the tree to loosen them . 
Then I placed the tree in the hole . 
I used a shovel to replace the dirt back over the tree roots . 
Once satisfied the tree was firmly in the ground i dragged over the hose . 
New trees needs lots of water . 
I watered the tree until I was satisfied and then put mulch around the base . 
I also attached ropes to secure the young tree so it would n't fall over while it 's roots were still settling in . 
I also had a canval funnel installed to make sure water went right into the roots where it was need most . 
Once all was said and done i stepped back to admire my handy work . 
I love baking cakes . 
That is why yesterday , I took it upon myself to bake the most delicious chocolate cherry cake the world has ever seen or tasted . 
It is called red velvet . 
So , first I went to the grocery store in the next town to get the necessary ingredients : flour , sugar , baking powder , yeast , artificial colors , butter , fake cherries , eggs and chocolate . 
Then , I drove my car home and spread out all the ingredients on the kitchen table . 
I pulled out my baking book and found the recipe to the cake I wanted to cook . 
I mixed the dry ingredients in one bowl and set them aside . 
Then , I took all the eggs and liquid ingredients and blended them in another bowl . 
Then I took both bowls and blended the ingredients . 
Then I preheated the oven to 350 degrees , and put the mixture in a glass pan with a buttered bottom . 
Then I baked it . 
If you love riding bikes when the weather starts getting better an important thing to know is how to repair your tire if you encounter a flat . 
Head on over to your local auto shop and find a patch kit , and make sure to invest in an air pump if you do n't have one . 
Sometimes the bike tire will go flat by losing air due to weather conditions . 
If this is your case , simply unscrew the cap and pump more air into the tire . 
If you have a puncture in a tire then you will need to try patching . 
By using the kit you just purchased you can find the problem area , install a mesh patch over it , and use the kit to fuse it to the tire . 
Once it has been applied you can fill the tire with air and enjoy your bike again . 
If the tire is still losing air then you will unfortunately need to invest in a new tire . 
When I was younger , I would occasionally get flats on my tires . 
Whenever it happened I would repair it as soon as I had the opportunity . 
In my garage I generally used a piece from an old inner tube and glue to patch the hole . 
Before I patch it however , I would remove the wheel from the bike frame using a socket wrench to remove the nuts that secure the tire to the frame . 
Then I would remove the inner tube from the outer tire . 
Then I would put the tube in a pan of water and look for bubbles and where they may be coming from ; the bubbles will lead me to the where the flat or flats are . 
I would then mark them with a marker or piece of tape , then cut a big enough section from the old inner tube I had in my garage and patch with the proper super glue and let it sit for at least an hour to properly harden . 
Then I would put the repaired inner tube back into the tire , put the tire back onto the bike , and then fill the tire with air . 
I was riding my bike yesterday and somehow I must have run over something and punctured the front tire of my bike . 
I measured my tire height and wrote down my model of my bike before I wen to the bike shop to buy a new inner tube . 
I go to the bike shop and the man behind the counter asked what I needed help with . 
I explained I needed a new inner tube for my bike since I had gotten a flat tire . 
I showed him the model number and the tire height an d he quickly went a got the inner tube I needed . 
I payed for my purchase , thank the man and went home to fix my bike . 
I took the front tire off and gently pried the outer tire off . 
The inner tube is sort of pliable so I stretched it over and off of the rim . 
I took the new inner tube and stretched it on the metal rim , making sure the stem when you inflate the tire was lined up with the hole on the metal rim . 
I replaced the outer tire and re-inflated the tire with my bicycle pump . 
Now I can ride my bike again ! 
As I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror today I realized that my hair was getting quite shaggy and long . 
I think that it was time for a brand new hair cut ! 
I went down to the barber shop and just as I should of known , coming in on a Saturday was not one of my most brightest ideas in hindsight . 
There was quite a crowd , but I figured I was already here so I might as well just wait . 
I went over and put my name down under my barber , Bill , who has been cutting my hair for the past 10 years . 
As I waited I grabbed a Sports Illustrated and sat down and began to read how the Pirates were doing in the World Series . 
After about 20 minutes or so Bill called my name up and asked me what kind of hair cut I wanted . 
I told him to stick with the usual and he put the big barber apron around me and began to cut my hair while we talked about life and caught up on what has been going on since the last time I saw him , which was about a month ago . 
Afterwards my haircut was done and I looked great ! 
We went up to the register and I paid him and gave him a good tip , then was on my way . 
Yesterday , I went to get a hair cut . 
I made an appointment with my hairstylist a week prior . 
I was tired of my long hair so I decided it was time for a new hair look . 
Even though , I wanted a new hair style , I was still very nervous . 
Cutting hair is a very big change . 
Before she cut my hair , she washed my hair . 
After she washed it , she did n't do a big chop . 
She cut little by little so I wo n't be in utter shock . 
Every time she cut it , I took a deep breath and accepted it . 
After all , hair does grow back eventually . 
Eventually she managed to cut it at the specific length I wanted it . 
Afterwards , she layered it and styled it properly . 
At this point , she did n't let me see the final result until she was finished . 
When she was done , she turned me over to the mirror and I was shocked . 
It was beautiful . 
I loved my new hair cut ! 
After a long day of work I decided to take a bath . 
First I put on some good relaxing acoustic music to listen to while I took the bath . 
Then I got the water nice and hot and then stopped the drain . 
After the tub was full I added lavender bubbles . 
I got a tray to place across the bath with my wine and a magazine and some chocolate . 
I sank into the water and sighed with relief . 
I drank three glasses of wine and haphazardly paged through the magazine . 
When I was done with my bath I pulled the plug and drained the water . 
Then I turned on the shower to rinse myself off . 
Once all the soap was off I stepped out . 
I dried off and then put on my robe . 
I was now done taking a bath and was ready for bed . 
I was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home . 
I started the car up , but I noticed that I left my phone at work , so I turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door . 
Unfortunately for me , I shut the door WITH my keys still in the ignition . 
That 's right ; I was locked out of my own car . 
Flustered and embarassed , I pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all . 
I walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what I would do next . 
There was no one there with me , so my only hope was riding the public bus -LRB- I did n't have money for a cab -RRB- . 
I waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop . 
The bus driver opened the door for me and I came aboard . 
I paid the two dollar bus fare so that I could ride and asked him for a transfer so that I could get on the next bus at the terminal . 
I took my seat , and the bus took me to the terminal at the plaza . 
I got off the bus and hopped on the bus that would take me home . 
I handed the transfer to the driver and took my seat . 
As I approached my apartment , I pushed the button to request for the bus to stop . 
The driver pulled over , and I thanked them and got off . 
When I got in the apartment , I immediately jumped into my bed . 
I was dead-tired , and though I had the dilemma of having my keys locked in the car , I would figure that out in the morning . 
Back in December of last year , I flew to Omaha , Nebraska to visit family for a week during Christmas . 
After packing what I needed , I took the bus to the airport where I had to get my ticket , go through security , get my suitcase checked , and find my way to the terminal to wait until the called for people to board my flight . 
When I got on the airplane , I put my luggage in the overhead and took my seat that was fortunately near the window . 
Once everyone was on the plane , the flight attendant announced that we were ready for take off and instructed all of us to fasten our seat belts , turn off our electronics , and read the safety manual . 
Then the pilot told us that he was about to take off and we then were finally flying in the sky . 
During my flight I sat next to an older woman and her dog that she was allowed to keep on her lap . 
We talked throughout the flight while snacking on the peanuts and soda that were given to us . 
When we finally landed about three or four hours later , we all exited the plane in a single file line while grabbing our belongings and once I was off of the plane , I went to go find my aunt who was suppose to pick me up . 
I had enjoyed my flight experience . 
I went to the corner market with my list of things I needed to buy . 
I grabbed a shopping cart and wheeled it up and down the aisles . 
I started at aisle one and went through each one in order to make sure that I got everything I needed . 
Fruit and vegetables were placed in flimsy plastic bags that the market provided for me . 
I got eggs and placed them in the cart 's basket so they would n't get broken . 
All other items were tossed in the cart . 
After I got everything on my list , I rolled the cart to the cashier . 
He scanned all my products and gave me a final , total price . 
A grocery bagger put all of my items in paper bags . 
I paid the cashier in cash and he gave me change . 
I thanked him , I thanked the bagger , and then I left with my groceries . 
I went grocery shopping today . 
I made a list of things that I needed before I left my house . 
When I got to the grocery store , I walked in the door and got a shopping cart . 
The next thing I did was look at my list to see which items I needed to find . 
My list said I needed to get bread , cheese and milk . 
First I went to the aisle of bread . 
There were at least twenty different kinds of bread . 
I picked out my favorite kind of bread , which is whole wheat , and put it in my shopping cart . 
Next I went to the dairy section of the store where I put a gallon of milk and a block of cheese into my cart . 
I then took my cart up to the front of the store where the cash registers where located . 
I put my items on one of the counters and a lady scanned each of them . 
She told me how much my groceries cost and I gave her the money to pay for them . 
A boy took my groceries from the counter and put them in a bag . 
He handed me the bag and thanked me for shopping with them today . 
Finally , I left and took my groceries home . 
I needed to do my weekly grocery shopping . 
I prepared by first looking through my cupboards and the refrigerator and freezer to see what I already had and what I needed . 
Then I made a list by category of everything I needed for the upcoming week . 
I drove to Shopper 's Food Warehouse , parked the car , found a cart near the front door and went in to begin my shopping . 
I started in the produce section and picked out everything I needed in the way of fruits and vegetables . 
Then I shopped for meats , cheeses , canned goods , milk , eggs , juice , bread , cereal , paper products , and frozen items . 
I went through the check-out line with my purchases and paid with a credit card . 
The cashier bagged all my items and put them back in the cart . 
I rolled the cart close to my car and unloaded the bags into the trunk of my car , then went home and put everything away . 
Being pregnant with my first child all I ever craved was chocolate cake . 
Every time I went outside I had to find somewhere to buy one . 
I was truly a chocolate cake addict but had no clue how to bake a cake . 
I decided to buy one from the supermarket out of the box . 
The recipe called for me to have water , oil and eggs which I had at home . 
In a rush I quickly read the directions and preheat my oven to 350 degrees . 
I poured the eggs , water , oil and cake mix in the box and beat it with my hand blender for about a minute . 
The smell of the gooey chocolate in the bowl make my little bundle of joy inside me kick for joy . 
When I was pouring it into the pan to bake it was hard to resist temptation of a taste . 
But knowing that raw eggs are unhealthy I decided to to the twenty five minutes until it was done . 
When my timer went off I removed it from the oven and tried a small piece . 
It was one of the most moist and delicious cakes I ever had . 
Today , I had to ride the bus home from the market . 
I walked over to the bus stop to wait for the next bus . 
It was supposed to arrive in 10 minutes . 
When the bus pulled up to the bus stop where I was waiting , I stood up and walked over to curb . 
The bus driver opened the bus doors and I stepped up into the bus . 
I had to hand my money to the bus driver so that I could ride . 
Once the driver took my money , I walked down the aisle to find a seat . 
There were many seats available so I picked one beside an older lady that looked like my grandmother . 
She was very nice and talked to me while we rode down the street . 
Once the bus stopped down the street from my house , I got off and walked down the sidewalk to my house . 
I was very glad to be home . 
One morning , I was brushing my hair and realized it stretched all the way past my shoulders . 
I had to pull so far and hard that I realized it was time to get it cut . 
I called my barber and scheduled an appointment for 1:00 . 
When it came time for my appointment , I drove to the barber shop and waited for my barber to call my name . 
I looked through some pamphlets showing all the fancy hairdos I could get , but I decided to keep my simple hairstyle . 
When my barber called my name , I sat down in a special chair in front of the sink and leaned my head back . 
My barber gave my hair a quick shampoo and a rinse so that it would be clean for him . 
Next , I moved over to a special , big chair and he wrapped a smock around me so that the cut hair would n't get on my clothes . '' 
`` Just a trim , '' '' I told him . 
He pushed a foot pedal at the bottom of the chair and I was raised upwards so that he could see more clearly . 
He began snipping at my hair with his scissors , and I watched him in the mirror . 
After some time , he put the scissors away and began combing my hair . 
It was all done ! 
He brushed the loose hairs off my neck and unhooked the smock . 
The parts of my hair he had cut away were all over the floor . 
I paid him and went home with my clean , shorter hair . 
I was riding my new bicycle when I stumbled over a rock or something . 
The tire seemed to explode upon impact . 
I struggled to stay atop the bicycle but was fortunately able to keep my balance . 
I knew that I had to fix my tire in order to use the bike . 
I knew the local gas station was only a few blocks away so I decided to walk my bike there . 
The first thing I did was get something to tape up the hole . 
The manager gave me some sort of sticky resin in order to patch things up . 
I went to the air pump to put some air into the tire and once it was full I was ready to patch it up . 
I used the resin to cover the hole and the tire seemed as good as new . 
I rode the bike home and made sure to avoid rolling over anymore rocks . 
My son in law cuts my hair . 
He texts me to come and get a haircut . 
I go to the upscale salon and get the royal treatment . 
It starts with me remembering how to get there easily . 
It is downtown and they are all one way streets and canyons . 
I find my lucky parking spot and go around the corner into the salon and am greeted . 
I noticed that they remodeled . 
I see my son in - law and says '' `` go get a smock '' '' . 
I went into the little room , picked out a black smock and put on and sit down . 
I come with my hair wet . 
He colors the hair , I sit under the dryer . 
We wash the hair , I get back in the chair and he cuts it . 
The whole thing takes a couple of hours . 
I always feel so beautiful on the way home . 
I took a bus to the train station and then walked into the big , brick building . 
There 's a bank of windows at the far side of the building . 
I went over to one of them and asked for a one way ticket to New York City . 
I paid for the ticket with my credit card and then went to sit on the hard wooden booths in the middle of the station . 
I looked up at the huge arrival screen at the front of the station . 
My train was listed there with a number of others . 
It said the train was on time and would arrive at the station soon . 
When it came in , there was an announcement that the train to New York was boarding . 
I got up and walked with about thirty other travelers down some stairs and along a long hallway , then up another flight of stairs and out onto a platform . 
The train was there next to the platform with its doors open . 
I walked into the train and took a seat by the window so I could watch things go by as we traveled . 
Soon the train started moving along the tracks . 
After a while the train 's conductor walked down the aisles saying , Tickets please . 
Tickets . 
over and over . 
I handed him my ticket and he punched a hole in it and put a ticket stub in the back of the seat in front of me . 
When the train got to New York City I got off the train and walked out onto one of the platforms at Grand Central Station . 
I went to my hairdresser a few weeks ago for a hair cut . 
My appointment was at 3:15 , so I arrived at about 3:10 . 
When I got there , Kayla -LRB- my hairdresser -RRB- was still finishing up with her last appointment . 
So I sat in the waiting area . 
The attendant at the desk offered me water or coffee , but I said no thank you . 
When Kayla was done with her last appointment , she called me in and I sat down in the swivel chair in front of the mirror at her station . 
She asked what I wanted done with my hair , and I showed her about how short I wanted it to be , a little shorter than usual . 
She noticed that my hair did seem to have grown a lot since the last time I was in . 
We went to a back room where there are sinks for washing hair . 
I sat down in front of the sink Kayla told me to sit at , then I leaned back to put my head in the sink , and Kayla washed my hair and conditioned it . 
Then she put a towel on my hair and we went back to her chair , where she cut my hair . 
While she was cutting my hair , we talked about a lot of things . 
Kayla has a young son so I asked about him . 
I also ended up talking to a woman who was getting her hair cut next to me . 
The time flew , and then Kayla used the blow dryer to dry my hair and curled it with a flat iron and put hair spray on it . 
I was very happy with my hair cut . 
I paid at the front desk and made sure to leave Kayla a tip , and then I went home . 
I wanted to take a train trip to New York City to visit my sister . 
I went to the Amtrak station in Boston and found the ticket office . 
As I stood in line , I looked at the board showing all the departure times to New York . 
Lucky for me , there was a train leaving in half an hour . 
I made my way to the front of the line and asked to buy a ticket for that train . 
I paid , then made my way to the platform for my train . 
The train was already there , so I looked on my ticket for my train car and seat number , then hopped aboard . 
I settled into my seat . 
Soon the train started moving . 
I took out my novel and started reading , only interrupted by the conductor coming to check my ticket . 
Before I knew it , we were pulling into the station in New York . 
It was my mother 's birthday last weekend and I wanted to bake her a cake . 
First , I looked up a recipes on the Internet . 
I found a chocolate cake recipe that looked very good . 
I was missing a few ingredients , so I made a quick run to the grocery store . 
Once I had what I needed , I got to work . 
First , I got out all of the baking pans that I would need to bake the cake . 
Then I got out all the ingredients and let them sit at room temperature for a bit . 
After prepping the pans , I preheated the oven and stirred the dry ingredients together . 
Then I added the butter , sugar , eggs , and flour . 
After everything was mixed well , I put the mixture in the pan and then put the pan in the oven . 
After 40 minutes , the cake was done . 
I let it cool and then added white frosting . 
My mom loved the cake . 
I love to ride the bus in my town . 
The fare is only 75 cents . 
It will take you anywhere . 
On Saturdays I get up early and walk down to the bus stop . 
I wait for the bus to come at 8:15 . 
I climb up the stairs and drop my fare into the collection box and say hello to the driver . 
Before the bus starts up again I move all the way to the back to sit in the last row of seats . 
Lots of different people get on . 
Some with shopping bags , others all dressed up and some like me dressed casual for a summer morning . 
I take the bus all the way until it gets to the center of town where I get off . 
Before i get off I get a transfer ticket . 
And then the fun begins . 
I look at the bus route map at the bus stop and look for a part of the city i want to explore . 
For 75 cents i can get to any part of my city . 
I see all kinds of people and get to explore the city I live in . 
I have the luxury of having a hairdresser for a mother , but if you were interested in getting a haircut you are in luck as it is quite a simple process ! 
If you have short hair like me feel free to frequent a local chain establishment as they do just as good of a job as the luxury salons . 
A place like Cost Cutter or Supercuts will work just fine . 
Generally you can show up without any announcement and will only have to wait for a short period of time . 
Make sure to sign in when you get there . 
Once you are called up sit in the chair and explain the details of your haircut to your hair dresser . 
Sometimes it helps if you bring a picture along with you . 
The haircut should be relatively quick if you have short hair , and then all you need to do is pay . 
It is suggested that you tip the hair dresser for your haircut . 
After this is done make sure to go to a public setting or over a friends house to see if they notice the new do ! 
I was traveling on vacation a few months ago , and decided to take a train to my destination instead of flying . 
I have always wanted to travel by train , and this was a good opportunity . 
I went online to look at the train schedules . 
There were quite a lot of them , so it took me a while to narrow down my choices based on when I wanted to leave and then arrive at my vacation destination . 
I finally was able to choose a time and date , and I purchased my tickets with my credit card . 
The day finally arrived to take my vacation . 
I went to the train station and checked in with the railway . 
They gave me a paper ticket , which I then brought to the rail line . 
When we boarded the train , we gave the ticket to a ticket taker , and he escorted me to my booth . 
It was fun and exciting . 
Finally after all the passengers were on board , we were off . 
The train seemed a bit jerky in the motion , but eventually it smoothed out . 
It was so much fun , seeing all of the towns and cities we passed through . 
Some we stopped at and some we just passed through . 
People would get on and off when we stopped . 
I was able to purchase some food in a car that sold sandwiches . 
I slept some in my car , which was a bit uncomfortable , but I did n't mind . 
Before I knew it , we had arrived at my vacation destination . 
I was really glad that I had taken a train , and was able to see a lot of our beautiful country . 
I was bored one weekend and decided I would like to read a new book . 
I checked in my wallet to make sure I had my library card . 
Seeing that I did in fact have the card , I got in my car and drove to the nearest branch of the public library , about four miles from my home . 
When I went in , I first checked out the new arrivals , both fiction and non-fiction . 
Then I looked at biographies , then at the books on the stacks for favorite authors . 
I finally decided on a few selections , two from the new fiction section and one from the new non-fiction section , as well as a book on poetry . 
I went to the check-out desk and presented the books along with my card to the librarian . 
She checked the books out to me along with a receipt which told me when the books were due back . 
I needed to fly out to visit my mom in another state , so I booked a flight on my favorite airline . 
When the day of the flight arrived , I already had my bags packed , because I plan ahead and packed them the previous night . 
Then it was time to drive to the airport . 
I parked my car at a nearby parking garage , and took a special bus called a shuttle to the airport . 
I arrived 2 hours early , because you want to make sure to have plenty of time to get through security . 
I went to the check in booth and gave them my information . 
I would have given them my larger luggage for them to put on the plane right there , but I was traveling light so I only had '' `` carry on '' '' luggage , which I got to bring with me to my seat on the plane . 
Then I went through the air port security , where I had to take off my shoes and jacket and walk through a scanner . 
Then I found the gate , the area of the airport where my Plane would arrive . 
I stayed near the area , visiting a few gift shops , until the plane arrived and we boarded it . 
Soon after , the plane went down the run way and took off . 
The flight was n't a long one , so they did n't offer us any food , but we did get a choice of drinks , and I chose a soda . 
Then the plane landed at the other airport , and we all got off the plane . 
Leaving the airport is much easier than entering it , and I was soon out of the building and met my mother in her car outside . 
My yard was very bare and plain-looking so I decided to add some trees to the landscape . 
First , I went to the local nursery and asked them for advice on what kinds of trees would do well in my area , level of sunlight , amount of precipitation , etc . 
They gave me some ideas and I picked out a Bradford pear tree sapling . 
I took it home and left it in shade while I prepared to plant it . 
First I got out a shovel and dug a deep enough hole to cover the whole root ball of the tree . 
Then I placed some fertilizer in the bottom of the hole . 
Next I unwrapped the root ball from the burlap sack which contained it and placed it in the hole that I had dug . 
Once it was in , I shoveled the dirt back into the opening and tamped it firmly around the base of the tree . 
After that I placed a soaker hose near it to give it plenty of water . 
My wife and I flew on an airplane a couple of months ago . 
We were going to Las Vegas because a friend of mine was getting married . 
He lives there and said that he would pick us up from the airport . 
But , the weather here was cold and there was freezing rain , so our flight was delayed for two hours . 
It was kind of scary taking off because the weather was still cold and rainy , but after two hours of sitting there waiting , I was ready to go . 
People on the flight were pretty happy to finally leave and a lot of people were having drinks . 
Everyone was getting ready for their own little party in Las Vegas . 
The flight itself took a little over four hours due to the fact that we had a non-stop flight . 
I was glad I paid the extra money for not making any stops . 
Six hours sitting on an airplane is more than enough for me . 
The flight was pretty uneventful except for the lively passengers , so that was a good thing , especially since my wife hates to fly . 
My friend ended up still picking us up from the airport and we had a great time in Las Vegas . 
Yesterday I rode the bus to school . 
The bus I get is the number 24 . 
It costs 60 cent when I am in my school uniform . 
I asked my parents for 60 cent and they gave it to me . 
I then made my way to the bus stop . 
The bus stop is about a 10 minute walk from my house . 
On my way to the bus stop I counted the money my parents gave me . 
When I got to the bus stop I waited for five minutes and then the bus arrived . 
The bus doors opened and I got on the bus . 
I said hello to the bus driver and told him where I wanted to go . 
I then put the 60 cent on the counter . 
The bus man took the money and gave me a ticket . 
I took the ticket from him and walked towards the seats . 
I sat near the front beside my friend Laura . 
She gets the bus with me every day . 
I put my schoolbag on the ground . 
We talked about what we had done the night before . 
The journey to school lasts about 15 minutes . 
After 15 minutes I heard the name of my destination being announced . 
I picked my bag up off the ground and walked towards the exit doors . 
I thanked the bus driver as I got off the bus . 
He wished me a nice day . 
I walked into the train station , stood in line , and purchased a round trip ticket to Chicago . 
I placed my ticket in my pocket and then walked outside to wait for the train . 
I stood next to many other people that were also waiting for the train . 
We heard the train coming when it was still a long distance away . 
It finally pulled up to the tracks . 
Everyone lined up to get inside the doors . 
The doors open and we all filed in . 
I found a seat by myself at the back of the train . 
I sat down and looked out the window at the passing towns . 
After awhile , the announcer said the next and final stop would be Chicago . 
I stood up and walked over to the doors . 
The train pulled into the station , making a loud screeching noise . 
It slowly came to a stop inside the station . 
The doors opened and all the passengers climbed off the train , and into Union Station in Chicago . 
This morning I arrived at the train station to take a train to my sisters house in Texas . 
I had pre-purchased my ticket for the Amtrak train leaving a 6 am . 
So I arrived around 30 minute before hand to check in and get to the platform in time to get my train . 
This was the first time have taken a long distance train and figured it would be similar to the local city trains I take to work each day . 
As the train boards I found my correct car and seat . 
I entered the car and saw how much nicer these trains are compared to the local one . 
The seats were similar to seats on a tour coach , and was actually quite nice inside . 
I brought a book along to read and help pass the time . 
I settled in my seat and a nice elderly woman sat down next to me , We exchanged pleasantries and she puled out a blanket she was crocheting for her grandson . 
I was fascinated with her work and she started to teach me as the train pulled away from the platform . 
She spent most of the trip working on the blanket as I watched . 
Eight hours later , it seemed like much less , the train pulled into the station and it was time for me to get off . 
I said good bye to the woman and thanked her for teaching me what she had . 
She went back to her work as I got off the train . 
My sister was waiting on the platform for me and we got into her car and headed to the nearest craft store to purchase crocheting supplies . 
I ride my bike to work everyday . 
I also ride for pleasure on the weekends . 
This morning I was pedaling along and all of the sudden I could feel the gritty pavement scraping the rim . 
I got off the bike and sure enough the front tire was flat . 
Well that is bad but not as bad if the rear tire was flat and I had to take the chain off . 
I always carry a spare inner tube and have a pump on the frame of my bike . 
This was going to be easy as I have done this many times before . 
I loosened the lock nuts that hold the front tire in place and pulled the tire from the frame . 
I looked in my bike pack and found the tool that helps take the tire off the rim . 
This took all of 5 minutes . 
When I had that off I took the old inner tube and placed it in my backpack to patch later . 
I then fit the good inner tube inside the tire and in reverse order fitted the tire to the rim . 
I next took my pump and filled it up to the correct pressure . 
I put the tire back on the front fork and tightened the locking nuts and was on my way . 
I was n't even late for work . 
I have a very important job interview coming up in a few days and I want to make sure I look my best . 
I called up my barber and made an appointment for later on in the day . 
When I got to the barber shop I greeted him and took a seat in his chair . 
I told him about the interview and he told me not to worry I was in good hands . 
He put the barber apron over me so I would n't get any hair on my clothes while he cut my hair . 
He took out his scissors and started sniping away like he usually did . 
After about 20 minutes we were all done . 
He took out a small mirror and showed me the front and back of my new haircut . 
As always I was very satisfied with his work . 
He dusted off the loose hair and removed the apron as I got up . 
I paid him and gave him a nice tip for a job well done . 
Before leaving he wished me good luck on my interview and thanked me for stopping by . 
Last week me and my family wanted to ride the bus to the zoo . 
We checked the bus timetable and headed to the bus stop . 
We waited for about 10 minutes and then the bus arrived . 
We got on the bus and asked the bus man how much a family day ticket would cost . 
He told us it was 10 euro . 
My mam paid him for the ticket . 
We went and sat at the back of the bus . 
Me and my siblings sat by the window so we could see when we were close to the zoo . 
We talked about what animals we wanted to see at the zoo . 
My favorite animals at the zoo are the monkeys . 
When we saw the zoo sign out the window we pushed the stop button and walked towards the exit doors . 
We thanked the bus driver and exited the bus . 
The zoo was right in front of us and we were all excited . 
We had a great day at the zoo . 
There 's nothing I love more after a long day at work then to come home to a warm bath . 
Most people think that taking a bath is a simple process . 
Oh how they are wrong . 
Taking a bath is actually a long process involving many steps . 
First I must start drawing the water which is a challenge in itself as I want to make sure it warm , but not too warm . 
Next as the water is still running I add a little bit of bubble soap for the added benefits . 
But I do n't just want bubbles I want a relaxing aromatherapy . 
With this in mind I add a little bit of essential oils and minerals . 
Finally I am ready to get into the water . 
But this is nowhere near the end of the process . 
Now I relax in the water while reading my novel and letting the oils soak into my skin . 
Ah this is how we are meant to relax . 
After a long day at work I decided I wanted to take a bath . 
I went into the bathroom put the plug into the drain and turned the water on in the tub so it would fill with water . 
Then I got undressed and grabbed a towel to use when I was done . 
I got in the tub and once it was full of hot water I turned off the tap . 
I got my hair wet and shampooed my hair and applied some conditioner then washed my body using some liquid body wash . 
I washed the soap off myself and washed the conditioner out of my hair . 
Then I just sat and relaxed in the tub for awhile . 
When I was ready to get out , I pulled the plug out of the drain , got out and grabbed my towel and dried myself off . 
Then I put on some clean clothes and blow dried my hair . 
Today , we went to the library to check out some books . 
A lot of people lke to borrow books from the library for all kinds of reasons but we just wanted some books to read for fun . 
We already knew which books we wanted before we got to the library so when we got there , we just had to find them . 
It is possible to look them up and find them on the libary 's computer . 
If you are in a hurry , you can ask the librarian to help you find them a little easier and more quickly . 
When we found out where to find the ones we wanted , we found them and took them to the librarian to check them out to us . 
She put the book information in the computer and then she swiped our library cards . 
It did n't take very long at all . 
when shed put them into the system and swiped the cards , she printed out a slip of paper that showed exactly what day we needed to turn them back in , in order to avoid any late fees . 
when we were ready to take them back , we turned them in to the librarian and then looked for more ! 
I decided to try baking a cake for the first time . 
Even though I was n't too sure about how to do it , I figured I would have fun trying . 
I looked up the recipe online and went to the store to buy all the ingredients . 
I set everything on the kitchen counter and went to work . 
I first opened all the packages of the ingredients . 
I then followed the recipe in full detail to make sure I did it correctly . 
As soon as I had everything properly mixed , I pre-heated the oven and made sure it was at the right temperature . 
When the timer indicated the oven was ready , I put the cake tray with the mixed cake batter inside . 
I waited for forty minutes until it was ready . 
I took out the cake and put chocolate frosting on top . 
The cake came out pretty well for my first time baking . 
In the midst of a great and cold winter , the color and feel of the surrounding enviornment had become depressing and lacking of color or warmth . 
As the days rolled by and the temperature flirted with hospitable warmth I planned the beginnings of a new spring garden . 
One of the new additions would be a fruit tree . 
Given the climate here in the south we are blessed with an ability to have both cold and warm types of trees to a certain degree . 
This would be a cold tolerant tree . 
I took an apple from some time ago that I had chilled seeds in the freezer for . 
The chilling of the seeds are supposed to mimick natural coldness and bring forth the seed easier . 
I then prepared the soil with fertilizer in a pot and planted the seed . 
The tree took off slowly as a sprout and a few years later has about 3 or 4 feet in height . 
I went to my grandmother 's house this summer and she loves to garden . 
She asked me to help her plan a lemon tree in her front yard . 
Since my grandmother was elderly and did n't have enough strength to shovel I did it instead . 
I dug a hole big enough from the tree . 
My grandmother had gone out to our local garden center and picked out a young lemon tree from their nursery . 
I grabbed the lemon tree from the pot and placed the bottom of the tree into the hole . 
I cover the roots and the hole with soil until it was all covered up . 
My grandmother sprinkled fertilizer and other plant nutrients into the soil . 
While she was doing that I grabbed the hose and turned the water on . 
I walked towards the lemon tree and sprinkled water into the soil . 
Hopefully the next time my grandmother and I meet to get to make lemonade . 
Yesterday , I stood at the bus stop for over twenty minutes waiting for VTA bus 323 to show up at my stop at my community college . 
After the bus arrived at the stop , I scanned my Clipper Card , which gives me unlimited VTA bus rides as long as I pay my school fee of $ 5 at the start of the quarter . 
I walked past several people sitting in the first front rows and decided upon a window-seat near the middle of the bus . 
I pulled out my headphones and started listening to my own music from my phone in order to pass the time . 
We took off five minutes later and arrived at the first stop in about five minutes . 
This is an express bus , meaning it takes limited stops . 
Another five minutes later we arrived at the second stop , which was mine to get off at . 
Before arriving at the stop , I pulled the cord to initiate the voice recording which states '' `` Stop Requested '' '' . 
The bus driver pulled to the side , I grabbed my backpack and all my other belongings and headed off the bus . 
As a young man I had always enjoyed watching the trains go by . 
Although there are no passenger trains anywhere near where i live there are trains that deliver to local plants and factories . 
One day I decided that as the train slowed down as it rumbled across the road while cars where stopped I would run and grab hold of one of the train car handles and sneak a ride . 
Off I ran . 
I grabbed the handle and thought my arm was going to rip off as I tried to pull myself onto the train . 
Finally I made it and climbed up onto the top of the train car . 
I rode like that for several miles enjoying the vibration and speed of the train as it rumbled along the tracks . 
When it slowed down enough before it 's next stop I jumped off and hit the ground rolling . 
Got battered and bruised but the experience was well worth the pain . 
Last week my boss told me that I needed to go to a meeting in New York . 
I decided the best way to get to New York was to take a train . 
I went online and bought a train ticket that would get me there well ahead of the meeting start time . 
On the day of the trip I went to the train station and stood in line at the ticket counter . 
When I got to the front of the line I told the agent my name and they pulled up my reservation on their computer and printed out a paper ticket . 
I thanked them , took the ticket , and left the counter . 
Once I left the counter I went to the gate to wait for my train to come . 
When my train arrived , everyone waiting for that train lined up and walked through the gate while the attendant checked our tickets . 
Once I walked through the gate , I went outside and boarded the train . 
Thankfully I was able to sit alone , and I pulled out a magazine to read . 
A little while after the train started moving the conductor walked through the train car to check everyone 's ticket . 
I handed my ticket to the conductor and he scanned it and handed it back to me . 
Now I could enjoy my train ride and get back to reading my magazine . 
A little while later the conductor announced that the train had arrived in New York . 
The train came to a stop , and I got off of the train along with everyone else . 
I was pleased that I had a pleasant train ride , and I walked quickly through the train station to go outside and catch a cab to get to my meeting . 
One day my bicycle tire got flat due to hitting some glass in the street . 
I then had to walk the rest of the way home . 
I took it into my garage and tried to repair it by putting some duct tape on it and pumping it with air . 
This , however , only made matters worst and all the air ended up making another hole in my tire because I over inflated it . 
I decided that I had no other options and I ordered a new tire on Amazon for my bike . 
Once that came in the mail it was time to repair my broken bike . 
I got a socket wrench and unscrewed the nut of the bike that attached to the wheel . 
After that I got my new bike tire and put it on the frame of the bike and screwed it back on . 
Once that was complete my bike was as good as new and I was back to riding my daily bike trail by my house . 
First , I called ahead to the salon and asked for an appointment to make sure they knew I was coming . 
I told them that I just wanted a hair cut , no coloring or curling . 
I did n't want anything complicated since that takes more time . 
I looked at the internet to find pictures of haircuts that I liked and printed them out . 
I arrived at the salon about 10 minutes early and waited patiently in the seating area . 
When it was my turn , I said hello to the stylist and showed her my pictures . 
I asked if she could do a haircut like that for me and if it would suit me . 
She said it would be fine . 
I sat down in the chair . 
She showed me about where she wanted to cut my hair , but I thought it was too short . 
I told her so politely and she adjusted the length until it was just right for me . 
Then , she washed and dried my hair and checked the length with me again . 
Once I said yes , she started to cut it . 
I liked how it was looking , so I did n't need to tell her to stop . 
She let me look at myself in the mirror . 
I liked it . 
I thanked her , paid for her services , and left a tip . 
Adventures By Train It was a Saturday and I felt like going on an adventure . 
I decided to drive a couple of hours away from home to this place that has an old-fashioned train that people can ride . 
It takes you along a river and into a wooded area where you can scenery and historical markers that you ca n't get to by car . 
I paid the fare and got on the train . 
I sat by a window where I would have a great view of the scenery . 
As the train got moving , I was glad that I had decided to ride this train . 
The scenery was amazing and I saw and learned information about historical markers that I had not known before . 
It was a fun day and I hated to see the train ride end when it did . 
I started out for home but new I would be back again someday to take this train ride again . 
Last year I got a job in downtown Atlanta . 
I live 25 miles from the downtown . 
So during commute hours it takes 1-1 .5 hours to get to job . 
In a day , I 'll be spending 3 hours in car with nothing else to do . 
So I started thinking about alternatives . 
How about taking public transport ? 
I checked online and found a route which is closer to where I live . 
I found that the best stop was right in front of my apartment complex which I had never noticed before . 
I started waking up by 6:30 . 
By 7 , I 'll reach the bus stop . 
The bus will come sharp at 7:10 . 
I need to swipe the transport 's card or pay in cash when I get into the bus . 
Usually there will be couple of seats vacant so I do n't need to stand . 
I will either sleep or read a book for the entire journey . 
Or I could talk to passengers . 
Overall it was a nice experience . 
Flying in an airplane for the first time can be a wonderful experience . 
Once you are all settled into your seat you will hear all the safety messages . 
These tend to be pretty boring but every now and then an airline will give the safety messages some new twist or humor . 
During the safety briefing , the plane will be heading towards the runaway for takeoff . 
Once the plane is ready for takeoff , all the flight attendants will sit and buckle themselves in . 
Next comes the best part - the plane will accelerate very quickly from sitting to flying in the air . 
The process barely takes a minute but you 'll feel the rush from going so fast . 
You 'll continue feeling the effects until the plane gets high enough into the air to reach a cruising altitude . 
Once this height is reached , you will barely notice you 're in the air unless you look outside the window . 
Last weekend I thought it would be neat to make my back yard more lively . 
I went to the local landscaping store and picked out some trees I thought would look nice in my yard . 
After returning home I called to my kids to come help me install the new plants . 
We all grabbed shovels , gloves , and buckets and went to work . 
We dug holes around the yard where we thought it would be nice to have the trees grow . 
We carefully each picked our favorite tree for each spot . 
Once we had settled on the location of each tree we set them in the holes and covered them back up with dirt . 
After placing some mulch around each tree to hold moisture it was time to water the plants . 
We were all pretty worn out by this time so we played rock , paper , scissors to determine who would have to get the hose and water the new trees . 
I ended up losing the game and was assigned the task of watering . 
I love to eat sweets , and on a day like today , I really could use a piece of cake . 
However , I was not sure that I would not have the ingredients necessary to bake a cake , plus , the kids are home , and I would have to include them in the activity . 
However , I decided to make baking a cake a family activity , and hope we could have some fun doing so . 
I quickly looked in the cupboards , and realized that I had enough ingredients to bake the cake . 
I got the mixing bowls , and the kids helped with the cracking of the eggs , and the mixing . 
I knew the anticipation of the cake was heavy on their minds , as it had been a while since I baked a cake . 
Once the mixing was done , I turn the oven on to preheat , and moved the kids to the island for safety . 
They took turns pouring the cake batter into the pan , and then I placed the cake into the oven . 
The hard part is now waiting , and I hate to wait , however , this cake was worth waiting for . 
As a treat , I allowed the kids to eat a tiny piece of the cake , as a thank you gesture for all their help . 
Planting a tree is an important activity for most of us . 
We need trees to survive , and we need to replace the ones that are being cut down . 
To do this , the right tools and location are necessary . 
I would begin by getting the striplings from a local nursery , as well as the right mulch and shovel . 
Next I would find the right spot , somewhere with plenty of shade and also sunlight , where the roots can grow and not destroy a sidewalk or driveway . 
With the right location in mind , I would dig down pretty deep , deep enough that it wo n't topple out or be dug out by passing dogs or anything . 
Once the hole is dug , I can plant the stripling , fill the remainder of the hole with mulch and dirt and then attach some type of thin but sturdy pole or stick next to the baby tree so that it will have something supporting it until it grows strong and tall . 
I love to save money everywhere I can , a penny saved a penny earned kind of philosophy . 
So when I analyzed our finances I saw we could save a considerable amount of money by doing more grocery shopping . 
I set up our strategy to go every weekend and budget about 200 dollars for the two of us each week . 
We like to go to Publix . 
We will start off buying produce , fruits and vegetables and such . 
Then we move over and look for the best deals on meat . 
We usually get fish , beef , chicken and pork . 
Next we 'll head over towards dairy and eggs . 
I like to get the 18 packs of eggs . 
They are protein loaded and super cheap . 
I 'll pick up some cottage cheese and about 4 to 6 pounds of cheese . 
We then get a couple of things out of the frozen section . 
I walked to the bus stop near my home so that I could get to work . 
I brought along my purse which had my bus card in it so that I could ride without paying cash . 
It only took a few minutes for the noisy bus to arrive . 
It stopped at the bus stop and the door opened . 
The bus driver scanned my bus card and I walked to an empty bench near the middle of the bus . 
Many other passengers boarded the bus after me and soon the bus was nearly full . 
Looking around me , I saw a number of senior citizens as well as other young adults . 
There was even a woman with a sleeping baby sitting on the bus near my bench . 
I decided to listen to music on my smart phone while I waited for the bus to reach my destination . 
The bus stopped every few minutes to let other passengers on and off of the bus . 
After about an hour , the bus stopped at my bus stop and I got up and walked out of the bus , wishing the driver a good day . 
I decided that I wanted to visit a town that was about an hour away from me . 
Rather than drive , I decided that it would be a good day to take a ride on the train . 
I made sure that I had all my things together and drove to the train station . 
I parked in the designated parking lot across the street , and went into the small station . 
I waited at the counter for a few minutes before an attendant strolled out from the office . 
She smiled and asked me where I would like to go . 
I told her that I 'd like a round trip ticket for today to the nearby town . 
She got on her computer to confirm my route and times , and I decided to purchase the tickets . 
I gave the attendant my money , and she put it in her drawer while my tickets printed off her printer . 
I thanked her , and set out the door to wait for my train . 
Shortly after I sat down , I could hear the sound of the train in the distance . 
Once it was stopped and unloaded , the conductor shouted all aboard ! 
and I gave him my ticket . 
I boarded the train and set off . 
And that 's how I rode the train . 
When riding bikes , sometimes the tires will go flat . 
This can happen either because you ran over something and there is a hole , or because the tire is leaking air somewhere . 
Sometimes you can just get a pump and refill the tire with air , and sometimes you need to replace the entire thing . 
There is this stuff that I have used before that worked for small holes though , it was like this foam stuff that is in a bottle . 
You just spray it in and let it sit for a little bit . 
the foam closes the hole up and you can refill the tire and everything works again if the hole was n't a bad one . 
If the tire is too far gone , you wo n't be able to repair it with anything and will end up replacing the whole thing or risk riding on the metal rims which can seriously damage your bike . 
Yesterday I used my new library card to borrow a book . 
It was so easy ! 
I drove down to the library early in the morning , just as soon as the library opened . 
When I entered the library , I said hi to the lady behind the counter , and went over to the science fiction section to look for a book that might catch my fancy . 
I soon found a very good looking book about a boy who meets an alien in his backyard . 
I really wanted to read the book , but I knew it would take me a few days , so I decided to borrow it for awhile . 
I brought the book up to the lady at the counter , and she asked me for my library card . 
I showed it to her , and she entered some information in the computer . 
She told me to bring the book back in one week . 
I promised I would , then I thanked her and went home to read the book ! 
Yesterday , I decided that I wanted to read a book and went to the library with my friend . 
We entered the library and started browsing through all the books . 
I remembered a mystery novel that I had read about and wanted to read . 
I went to the library 's computer and looked up the title of the mystery book to see if it was available . 
Luckily , it was available for me to check . 
I wrote down the call number and located the book in the stacks . 
I found my friend and told her that I found a book that I wanted to borrow and was ready to check out . 
I waited in line at the checkout counter and when I reached the front of the line , I greeted the librarian . 
I handed him the book and my library card and he scanned both into the library 's system , successfully borrowing the mystery book . 
I started reading it today and it is really good . 
I 'm so happy I found it at the library yesterday . 
The first time I rode a public bus was in high school . 
I needed a ride to get home from school since no family members could get me . 
So I waited for the bus until it came . 
Then I stepped onto the bus , I inserted the fee of two dollars into the cash machine and the driver waived me on . 
I went and took my seat and minded my own business . 
Once the bus was on its way , I waited until we were close to my house . 
I then pulled on the yellow stop cord that is hung throughout the bus . 
It sends a message to the driver that someone on the bus wants to get off at the next stop . 
When the driver pulled up to a stop , I got off , I said thank you to the driver to be polite and grateful and he nodded his head at me . 
Then I walked the rest of the way home . 
I had always thought it would be hard and gross to take a public bus , but it was actually kind of nice . 
There are also seat belts on public buses , but you are not required to wear one if you do not want to . 
As my car was not working correctly I decided to take a public bus . 
I called the bus depot and asked how much tickets where and the departure times . 
The rates where reasonable for what I needed and I really did n't have a choice in the matter as my own car was messed up . 
I had a friend take me to the bus stop where I purchased my round trip ticket and prepared to wait for the bus to load and leave to take me to my destination . 
I went to the restroom to double check my concealed handgun and make sure it was cocked , locked , and loaded as you can never be too safe . 
My gun was fine so I tucked it under my shirt and boarded the bus . 
I found a seat near the back where I could see most of the other passengers and kicked back to make the trip . 
I started using my local library after I canceled cable . 
It turns out that they have thousands of dvd 's and blue ray movies available for free . 
I live in a pretty decent sized town , so the library is actually really nice . 
One day my daughter and I were looking for movies . 
She told me about needing to download a book because she had seen a movie recently and wanted to read the book now . 
She was kind of shocked when I suggested that we look for the book at the library . 
She thought that people just used the computers there and borrowed movies . 
She did not think that they would have the book that she wanted . 
She thought that the only books there were encyclopedias and old books . 
She was really surprised when we were able to find the book that she had been wanting to download . 
Now , she would rather read a regular paper book than read a book on her tablet . 
This kind of made me happy . 
The library is a magical place where dreams are made real and fantasies are explored . 
As I walk through the aisles and aisles of books I ca n't imagine what to choose . 
There are so many that my mind ca n't keep up . 
I love to read and I do it daily . 
It is my favorite hobby and I spend a majority of my time either at home reading or at the library finding new books to read . 
The best part about the library is not having to buy the books or spend money . 
You simple give them your card and they let you take the book home for a long enough period to read and bring back . 
If the book is too long to read then you can simply check it out again and bring it back when you are finished . 
As long I keep a good standing with the library I can keep doing this all my life ! 
Planting a tree is a very difficult task . 
First , I went to Walmart or another nursery in the area and pick a tree . 
When I get to Walmart , I asked the cashier for which trees are easiest to take care because I can not take care of plants very well . 
Then I figured out whether I want a tree for the sun or shade . 
When I picked a tree , I took it to the cashier and paid for it . 
Then I put the tree in the back of my car and went home . 
Next , when I got home , I took the tree outside and figured out where I wouldput it in the yard . 
Afterwards , I dug a whole where the tree would go . 
The hole was the size of the pot of the tree . 
Then I pulled the tree out of the pot and put the whole thing in the hole I dug . 
Then , I covered the sides with more dirt and put some fertilizer and water around the tree so it set in the ground . 
It was my son 's birthday so I decided to bake him a birthday cake . 
I went to the store and bought chocolate cake mix , oil , eggs , and frosting . 
Then I set about making the cake . 
I turned on the oven to preheat it . 
Then I grabbed a big bowl to mix everything in . 
I put in the cake mix , the oil and eggs . 
Then I found the electric beaters and beat the concoction until it was smooth . 
Then I grabbed the pan that the cake would be baked in and greased the sides of it . 
Then I poured the cake batter into the pan . 
Then I put the pan into the oven that had been preheated . 
I set a timer to thirty minutes . 
When the timer went off I stuck a knife into the cake to see if it was done cooking and it was . 
As I was looking in my cabinets and fridge for something to fix for my families supper I realized that a trip to get groceries was very much needed as I was low on food supplies . 
I grabbed a pen and paoper and made me a list of all that was needed . 
I then got dressed and ready . 
I inspected my handgun to make sure it was cocked , locked and loaded and placed it securely on my right hip . 
I then made sure I had a extra magazine of ammunition in my left hand pant pocket . 
All that being good I got in the car and off to the store I went . 
I always start by getting the dry and canned goods first so that my perishables will stay fresh until I get them home . 
So many canned items , dry items , then meats and ice cream and frozen goods later I went home and put everything away . 
I buy tickets far ahead , to save money . 
When the day approaches , I pack carefully , excluding oversized toiletries , liquids , explosives and anything else likely to be viewed as contraband . 
I also remind myself not to joke about this stuff at the airport , and to be absolutely cooperative . 
I wear slip-on shoes , arrive an hour early , get in line and do as I am told . 
Usually this means a brief scan and luggage overlook . 
It 's much like crossing a border , and only slightly more intense . 
Then I wait on the other side of the checkpoint , with everyone else . 
I am careful to bring snacks and slippers in my carry on luggage , and I read rather than paying for entertainment . 
The flying etiquette of Coach class is to leave fellow passengers alone , and I do that . 
I also avoid those tiny bathrooms if I can , because I feel confined enough just being on the plane . 
Over the summer , my friend and I decided to plant a tree . 
We always wanted to plant one but we never had the time to do it . 
Now we had the time and we were determined to plant the tree . 
We decided to plant the tree in my backyard since I have the bigger backyard . 
We , first , got all of our utensils and started planting the tree . 
We dug a hole and poured the seeds inside the hole . 
We covered it up with dirt . 
We then poured water over it . 
Every day , we would water the seed . 
We always hoped that the tree will miraculousy grow in weeks but we knew that was n't possible . 
It would take years for it to grow . 
We were so happy about planting our first tree that we decided to help our community parks now . 
We decided to help plant trees there as well . 
It may take years , but we know that we are contributing to our environment . 
When I was a kid , my dad was a licensed pilot and he had a small plane . 
It seated 4 . 
He lived in a small town about 2 hours by car north of the larger town when we kids lived with our mom . 
We would go visit my dad every other weekend . 
My grandfather was a pilot too and had a small plane . 
His was smaller , though , and only seated 2 people . 
It was fun to fly in because I got to sit in front and see out the front and watch him work the controls . 
When we flew with my dad , my stepmother sat in the front seat and all three of us kids sat in the back seat . 
We were small , so we all fit . 
There was n't much room for luggage , but my dad would load the luggage behind the back seat . 
Then he would do the preflight checks . 
Some of these were outside the plane , but most of them were done from the inside . 
He would radio the tower and ask for permission to take off . 
This was always very exciting . 
The takeoff was a little scary because in a plane that small you could really feel the wind and the forces of the take off . 
The flight itself was fairly boring because you could n't really see anything from the back . 
Sadly , I had bad motion sickness , and my main memory of the landings is throwing up down the back of my dad 's neck . 
Borrowing a book from the library is so nice and super simple to do . 
I love doing this because if you want to read a book and not buy it , then just go borrow it from the library . 
Almost every library will add new books to their collection if you ask . 
You just need a library card and you can get one from any library since they are free if you have a picture ID card of yourself and an address where you reside . 
If you know what type of book you want , you can go to the section of the library that has that category or you can ask a librarian to help you . 
If you ask politely where a certain book is , they are more than happy to help you find the book . 
So once you find the book you are looking for , you take it to the checkout desk and present them with your library card , then they punch the card into their computer system and scan the barcode on the book so they have a record of who has what book . 
They then tell you when the book is due , and for the next designated time frame , you can spend your time enjoying the book you are borrowing from the library . 
I go to the library just about every day and find a good book to read and I sit outside and read it . 
I went and got the Divergent book and started reading it today in the library . 
I had to ask the librarian where to find it in the library since it was not where I thought it would be , She kindly helped me find it and asked what types of books that I enjoy reading and suggested some for me to check out after I finish this one and then I went on my way to dive into this book and enjoy the story since I saw the movie last week . 
Last summer , I decided I wanted to visit some family and friends of mine whom resided on the other side of the country . 
I carefully considered my travel options and expenses , and decided it would be most economical to take the train . 
Traveling by train is an easy and straight forward experience , but is also fun and enjoyable . 
To begin , I visited the railroad 's website and booked my ticket . 
The ticket was then sent to me via email , which I could print out or display on my mobile device . 
On the day of travel , I arrived at the train station about a half an hour early and waited for the train to arrive . 
When the train arrived , the conductor stepped off and asked for tickets . 
I had elected to use my mobile device to display my ticket , so I showed the ticket to the conductor and he scanned it with his phone . 
I was then directed towards my assigned seat . 
I settled in for the ride , with food and entertainment I had brought with me . 
For most of the ride however , I was glued to the window , enjoying the sights of town after town that we traveled through . 
The next day I arrived at my destination . 
I gathered my bags and stepped off the train , knowing I would return again very soon . 
Last night I had a meeting in the city . 
I live about an hour train ride from the city . 
I got ready in my house and walked out of my house leaving plenty of time to get to my meeting on time . 
I had to refill my metrocard with more money for the train fare . 
They have raised the train fares again . 
I enter the train station , payed for my metrocard at a machine , and walked down the stairs to wait for my train . 
I need to take two trains so I will switch for another train at another stop . 
My train arrives quickly and I manage to get a seat because it was n't too busy . 
After getting off the first train and switching for another train 45 minutes later , I arrived at the destination and was on time for the meeting . 
Now I have to repeat the commute home after the meeting and hope it will be as smooth . 
Before I go into the bathroom I always grab a towel from the linen closet where we keep our towels , soap and shampoo . 
I like to put a radio on while I take a bath so I can relax and enjoy myself . 
I plug the tub with a water stopper and turn on the water so it 's nice and warm but not too hot . 
I put in some bubbles so it makes it nice and bubbly and smelling good . 
When the tub is all filled I stop the water and slowly get inside . 
I sit down for about ten minutes relaxing with my eyes closed and just thinking about the day . 
After about ten minutes I take the stopper out so the tub can drain and turn the shower head on . 
I like to wash myself off after a bath because there are a lot of bubbles all over me . 
I love taking baths because they are very relaxing . 
Today I decided to go to the library and borrow a book to read . 
The library is my local public library , and it is very big so there are many options to choose from . 
When I arrived , I began walking up and down the aisles , reading the titles on the books and looking at ones that had titles that caught my eye . 
I made my way through the fiction section , as this is what I prefer to read . 
I perused many genres , including fantasy , horror , thriller , and mystery . 
I finally settled on a book by Stephen King - arguably one of the best horror writers of all-time . 
It was a book I had read before , but I enjoyed it enough to read again . 
After making my selection , I made my way to the self-scanner to check out my book . 
I scanned my library card so that the book would be logged under my account , then I scanned the book itself . 
Finally , I was done ! 
I left the library and went home to sit down and read . 
Most people grocery shop once a week . 
In my house that really does n't work for us ; my wife and I work shifts that could change and we never know when our son will or wo n't be home so when I shop for groceries it 's only looking one or two days ahead . 
There 's two places that I usually go for my groceries ; I either shop at Wegmans , which is a grocery store near where I work , or Walmart , of which there are two near me , about equal distances from where I work . 
I 'll talk to my wife before I leave work , we 'll decide on dinner and then I 'll go to whichever store I decide on -LRB- for example , if we 're having fresh meat we prefer to get it at Wegmans , but if we 're making a casserole or something similar I can get it at Wegmans -RRB- . 
I 'll leave work , head to whichever store I 've chosen and , without spending alot of time wandering , get the exact items I need , pay for them and leave . 
To me , grocery shopping is more of a necessity than something I enjoy so I want it done quickly . 
The Empty Refrigerator One evening I returned home from work and realized that I was very hungry . 
However , when I opened the door to my refrigerator , I saw that there was nothing in it besides a gallon of water and a half-used bottle of ketchup . 
I opened my freezer to only find two trays of ice . 
This did not look promising at all . 
Since I was very hungry , I decided to go out to eat and then go grocery shopping . 
I went to eat at a restaurant near my favorite grocery store and then started my grocery shopping quest . 
I first went to the produce aisle and picked out an assortment of fruits and vegetables . 
I then proceeded to the meat section where I picked out some chicken , pork chops , hamburger , and a beef roast . 
Next , I picked up some canned items and some taco shells , taco seasoning , pizza crust mix , and peanut buttter . 
After this , I went to the dairy section and picked up some cheese and milk . 
My next stop was the frozen section where I tossed some ready-made meals in my cart along with chicken strips , frozen vegetables , tator tots , and frozen pizza . 
Before I made it to the checkout area , I picked up a loaf of bread . 
I know had a good assortment of food and it would be a long time before I would come home to an empty refrigerator and freezer again which was a very good thing . 
Going grocery shopping is a routine task for most people . 
As most groceries nearby now require the use of reusable tote bags rather than offering paper or plastic bags , the trip usually begins at home with remembering to take along a tote or two . 
I begin my trip by starting down the aisle to either the far right or left and continuing from there . 
If the store offers an ad at the door I will usually pick one up and decide if there are any deals I wish to take advantage of . 
Keeping an eye on my spending is importnat , as grocery expenses can add up quickly . 
If I am doing major shopping I will use a cart , but if I 'm just stopping for a few items , a hand basket will suffice . 
When paying for my items I do my best to find the shortest line with the fastest checker so I can be in and out as quickly as possible . 
It was in last spring , when we were taking photos by standing in front of our house , we felt like our photos lacked something . 
Later we reached a conclusion that we do n't have enough green around our house . 
So we thought it would be nice if we plant a tree in our yard . 
So we started our search on trees . 
During summer time a lot of rabbits come to our house and destroy all plants . 
Therefore we are in need of a plant that should n't attract rabbits . 
We read reviews of different types of trees . 
At last we reached a conclusion to buy a maple tree so that we can enjoy fall too . 
We were new to planting a tree , so we watched some videos to get some information . 
In one website they suggested to plant a somewhat tall plant rather than a small plant . 
So we went to Home Depot bought a plant and a shovel . 
It was a very beautiful maple tree . 
After reaching home I dug a pit just to fit the plant base which was packed with some soil . 
Me and my wife held it and kept the plant in to the pit and removed the plastic sheets which wrapped the plant base together with the soil . 
After that we poured the soil back to the pit and made the plant to stand straight . 
It was a please experience . 
I was running low on food , so I decided to take a trip to the grocery store . 
First I wrote down a list of everything I would need . 
Then I hopped in my car and drove over there . 
I parked where I could find a space and headed into the store . 
I grabbed a shopping cart and went over to the bread section . 
There I picked out a good loaf of bread . 
After that , I looked at all the fruits and vegetables . 
I picked out a bag of oranges and kept going . 
There were a few more items on the list , so I found each one and put them in my cart . 
Once I finished finding everything on my list , I went over to the check out lines . 
I found a line with only one person in front of me , so I waited there . 
When it was my turn , I put my items on the conveyor belt . 
Then the cashier scanned my items and gave me a total . 
I swiped my credit card and paid for my items . 
She then gave me a receipt , and I took my cart back to my car . 
I unloaded my bags into my car , and put the cart back in the cart corral . 
Finally , I drove home . 
I go to my bedroom and select clean clothes to put on after taking a bath . 
Go into the bathroom and turn on the water at let it run until it reaches a comfortable temperature and reaches a good height . 
I undress and gently touch the water with my foot to ensure its comfort . 
Then I go fully into the water and take a deep breath for relaxation . 
I soap up my wash clothe and start cleaning the parts of my body that are not exposed to the water . 
After that I stand up and finish soaping my the remainder of my body . 
I start letting the water drain while turning on the shower and wash my hair . 
I completely rinse off and dry myself . 
Then I get dressed and put on some after shower cologne . 
I exit the bathroom but leave the door open to remove the steam . 
A nice relaxing bath is now complete . 
Last night I decided to take a bath to help me relax . 
I gather all the things that will help me relax with a bath such as bath salts , bubble bath , and candles to place in the bathroom . 
I draw the bath by running warm water into the tub and then adding my favorite bath salts and bubble bath . 
I light some candles for a nice lighting effect and to add some aromatherapy and fragrance to the room to help me relax . 
I also gather a few of my favorite magazines to read while I am in the bath . 
As soon as the water filled the tub and at the right temperature , I get into the tub and let the bath salts and bubbles relax me . 
I will spend some time in the tub closing my eyes , relaxing , and then reading my magazines . 
It has been a long day and this bath will help me relax to go to sleep . 
Everyone knows that cleanliness is close to Godliness . 
It was this mind frame that led me to take my third bath of the day a few minutes ago . 
I had decided to go outside and shoot my assault rifle and do some pistol drills since it was such a warm and beautiful day outside . 
The sweat started coming from my body as I trained hard and the spent gunpowder began to cling to my sweat moistened skin . 
Soon I was rather stinky and covered in gun powder . 
Time to go inside , clean my weapons and prepare a good hot bath . 
Not just any bath but one that is piping hot and with bubbles in it . 
I removed my clothing and carefully put one foot in the hot water . 
Ouch ! 
Very hot just the way I like it . 
I eased my body into the tub , lit a cigarette and soaked away the fatigue of my previous workout . 
My family and I arrived at the station early in the morning because we had to make sure we were on time . 
Normally we are late to almost everything we do , so if we shoot for being early that normally means being on time . 
The train pulls up and we show our tickets and climb aboard . 
We choose to ride the train because the plane tickets were simply way to expensive . 
On the train we get drinks and some snacks to pass the time . 
We also play cards and talk the entire ride so that in no time we have arrived at our destination . 
The train had no problems and it seemed like the fastest ride I had ever been on . 
If we would have taken a plane it may have even taken longer than this ride had taken because of all the unfortunate things you have to go through at an airport . 
The train ride was an enjoyable experience and I look forward to heading back home on the next train . 
'' `` Riding A Public Bus '' '' Hannah and her mommy had just moved to the city . 
Daddy took the car to work each day now and her and mommy decided they wanted to go to the shopping center . 
Hannah was excited because today was her first time taking the public bus . 
Hannah and her family had moved to Portland , Maine and the bus they were taking was called the Metro . 
Hannah took her mom 's hand as they walked down the sunny streets of the city until they reached a sign that Hannah could not read but she did understand the picture . 
It was a picture of a bus . '' 
`` Does that sign say bus mommy ? '' '' 
Hannah asked . 
Her mother replied that it was and it was one of many many places around the city to get the bus to stop for them and others . 
They waited for a long while and finally a large public bus came down the street and stopped before them . 
They waited while a few passengers exited the bus because her mom said it was the polite thing to do and then they climbed the steps where her mother dropped their coins into the busses toll collector . 
Her mother then asked for a transfer and they walked quickly to their seats . 
Hannah asked her mom what a transfer was and she explained that because they were going way across the city they would need to get on yet another bus and the transfer was so the other bus driver could see they already paid for their ride . 
Soon the bus jolted to another stop an older lady stepped onto the bus and flashed a card at the bus driver and took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and handicapped people . 
Hannah tugged at her moms sleeve and whispered the lady did not pay . 
Her mother quietly told her she had a bus pass that she paid for a whole months worth of rides for a bigger fee than just one ride . 
That people who use the bus daily buy them to save money . 
Hannah thought to herself she would like bus passes for her and mommy . 
She enjoyed the bumpy ride with the jolting stops and wide turns that made her have to hold on tight . 
Hannah also noticed people pulling a cord and she figured out why . 
It made the bus driver stop where ever they would like to get off . 
Oh how she wanted to pull the string but , mommy told her no . 
It was only for when you needed it . 
Soon the bus stopped at the busy bus station . 
They stepped off the bus and got on a new bus . 
Her mom handed the bus driver their transfers . 
Hannah was excited because this meant the next place they were going was the shopping center to buy her new shoes . 
Soon the bus took off and made stop after stop . 
They even picked up a man in a wheelchair . 
He drove his wheelchair right up a special ramp and into a spot on the bus where the driver buckled him and his wheelchair in . 
Soon Hannah 's mom told her she could pull the cord to make the bus stop . 
The cord was up high but with a little help from her mom she reached it . 
Ding ! 
The bus came to a stop shortly after and there was the shopping center right in front of them . 
Taking the bus was a fun form of transportation . 
Hannah waved to the driver as he pulled away to pick up and drop off even more people around the city . 
Today is grocery day , I go every Thursday . 
I check the paper on Wednesday and try to to match all the coupons I can to each sale . 
I grab my coupon book and head it to the store . 
AS I walk in there are item s stack that are unadvertised deals and I check the out to see if I need anything . 
I walk into the store and the way it is laid out I can easily find the items that I need pretty quickly , grocery shopping is not my favorite past time , I go to the deli counter and get lunch meat for help yourself nights and school lunches . 
I then head to the meat department to get some chicken and a roast for Sunday . 
Now time for the isles and my coupon matches , I head down each isle relativity quickly since I already know pretty much what I am going to buy and how much of it I need . 
I finish each isle and have all of my necessities . 
I go over to the bakery to see what they have on sale today and see a large carrot roll with cream cheese filling . 
So I place that in my cart and head for the checkout isle . 
I place all my purchases on the belt near the cashier and watch as each one is scanned , She totals my purchase and I pay for them . 
As I leave the store I look at my watch and realize it took me much less time as usual . 
Now I can enjoy the rest of my day ! 
I needed to go on my weekly grocery shopping trip last weekend . 
So , I went to my fridge and started to make a list of the cold items that I would need . 
Then , I checked out my cabinet to be sure that I picked up a few canned goods that I needed as well . 
I checked through my coupons and took the ones that I needed . 
I grabbed my wallet , helmet , sunglasses , and my insulated backpack and went outside to get on my bike . 
After going through traffic , I arrived at the store and parked my bike . 
I went into the store and grabbed one of the smaller carts , since I would not need to get too many things this trip . 
I put my backpack and helmet in the cart and went inside . 
I just needed some cream , milk , eggs , sausage , cheese , and some veggies . 
I dodged around other shoppers and headed towards the veggies . 
Salad blends were on sale , so I picked some up . 
I also grabbed a nice head of broccoli as well . 
Then I went to the refrigerated section and selected my meats and things , being sure to check for discounted meats . 
My list was all checked off so I went to the self-checkout to pay . 
I scanned my items , ran my coupons , and paid . 
I loaded my items into my backpack and put both it and my helmet on and left the store . 
There are times when I need to get somewhere without using my car or without using the tube . 
For these times I use Transport for London 's public bus system . 
One such time just happened yesterday . 
I wanted to go from my flat to the bumping club in Shoreditch . 
Unfortunately it was past midnight and the tubes were closed . 
I decided upon taking a bus instead of taking a minicab or a taxi . 
I found the bus stop and waited patiently for the correct bus . 
Stepping on I tapped in and greeted the driver . 
He seemed very nice , as did the people on the bus . 
It was filled with many other revelers who were in similar states of intoxication . 
We rode towards our destination , a popular club , in unison . 
I met a pretty girl who I talked with at length . 
We decided we were going to dance together at the club ! 
All in all it was an exciting and enjoyable ride on a London double decker bus ! 
My car was in the shop , so today I decided to commute to school on a public bus . 
First , I looked up what bus I would need . 
I found I need to take two buses and transfer in the middle . 
I started walking to the first bus stop and arrived ten minutes before the bus was scheduled to arrive . 
It came on time , and the bus driver let off the other passengers . 
I stepped onto the bus and paid the driver the fare . 
Then I found an open seat by a window and sat down . 
The ride was around 15 minutes or so . 
Then the driver announced my stop . 
I headed out the back doors . 
Outside , I found a bench and sat down . 
The next bus came fairly quickly . 
I hopped on and showed the driver my transfer ticket . 
This time , the bus was packed , so I found a pole and hung on . 
The ride was n't too long , however , and soon I was at my final destination . 
I found my way off the bus and walked over to school . 
I had been outside playing basketball for several hours . 
It was a hot day and I got quite sweaty and dirty . 
I was sort from so much activity and just walked through my front door . 
The first thing I did when I got to my bathroom was disrobe and started the warm water -- I was going to prepare a bath to soak in it and relax my sore muscles from so much activity while also cleaning the sweat and grime from myself from working up such a sweat . 
The water filled the bath and I got in and sat in the warm water for the better part of an hour , enjoying the relaxing bath as the ache and tiredness in my muscles washed away . 
I cleaned my hair with some shampoo and washed my body with a washcloth and rinsed off with the shower head as I was finishing up . 
I dried off and sat on the couch for hours later . 
One time I drove over a piece of glass and it put a hole into my bicycle tire . 
I had to walk my bicycle all the way home , which was very unpleasant , and then I could not use my bike again until I had fixed it . 
So I looked up online how to fix a punctured tire , and went to the hardware store to pick up the necessary tools . 
After purchasing these tools I pumped some air into the tire to locate the hole and then I took the tire off of the wheel to repair it . 
I followed the directions on the repair kit which were actually very simple . 
After I had patched the hole , I waited for the adhesive material to dry and then I took the bike out for a short test run to make sure that if the tire failed again I would not be far from home . 
Some years ago , I used my bike to get around town a lot . 
Of course , came the time when you have to make repairs . 
I found out a lot about bicycle tires during this time . 
My tire had a leak so I bought a repair kit . 
I had no idea how to use it but I did find out . 
I had to take the whole wheel off the bicycle . 
Next I pried the tires from the rim and that took some doing . 
Okay once I got that off I had to take the inner tube out also and I learned that I had to be very careful with the inner tube because I could cause more damage by being rough . 
Next , I took the inner tube to the gas station to get air since I did n't have a manual air pump . 
I learned really quickly that I needed to fill the inner tube with care or I would be buying another one since the air fills it quickly and the tube can pop . 
Once I put a little air in the tube I had to listen as I pressed the air out to determine where the leak was actually at . 
Once the leak location was identified then I was able to take the tube home and use the glue from the kit and apply the rubber patch . 
Of course I had to allow the tube to dry and then deflate it to get it back on the bicycle . 
Once I got it all put back together I walked my bike back to the gas station for air . 
I was going to go on a bike ride with a friend . 
I pulled my bike out of the garage only to discover I had a flat tire . 
I was n't sure if the flat was just from a slow leak or a bad tube . 
If it was from a bad tube I would have to use tools to take the tire completely off . 
Then I would have to replace the tube . 
If it was just a slow leak I could just inflate the tire with my air pump and be on my way . 
I decided to try the easy route first and inflated the tire with the pump . 
It felt as if the tire was full and the problem was solved . 
I took the bike for a test ride around the neighborhood just to be sure that it was fully inflated and would stay that way . 
It stayed inflated and I set off to meet with my friend . 
My hair was getting long and it was getting hard to style it . 
It looked like it was time to get a haircut . 
I called the hair salon to see if I could get an appointment with my favorite hairdresser . 
She told me she could see me that afternoon at 3pm . 
I drove to the salon , parked my car and went in . 
I sat down on one of the chairs in the waiting area . 
There were several other people waiting to see their hairdresser . 
There was an assortment of magazines on a table in the center of the waiting area . 
My hairdresser was still working on another client , so I picked up a magazine to read while I waited my turn . 
When she was ready for me I walked over to her station and sat down . 
The chair was operated by hydraulics , and she adjusted the height so she could reach my head easily . 
There was a large mirror in front of the chair , and a small shelf that held combs , brushes , and other tools . 
She placed a white tissue around my neck and then a black plastic cape which covered my shoulders , back and front . 
She then squirted a liquid from a spray bottle over my hair to wet it and combed it through . 
Although she has been cutting my hair for quite a while , she asked how I would like my hair cut since I might have decided to change the style . 
When I told her what I wanted she began to hold up sections of my hair in her fingers , using a small scissors to cut each piece . 
When my entire head of hair was cut , she took a blow dryer and brush and dried and styled my hair . 
When she was finished she gave me a small hand mirror and turned my chair around so I could see the back of my hair in the reflection of the large mirror . 
I was happy with the way it came out and told her so . 
She then removed the cape and tissue and we went to the front of the salon where I paid her for the cost of the haircut . 
She put the money in a cash register and I gave her some extra money as a tip , since I was so pleased with how my hair looked . 
After a long day , nothing really relaxes me like a long , soaking bath . 
The entire activity for me is something I enjoy and start looking forward to before I 've even left work . 
First I 'll get home and start the tub ... I like the water to be hot to the point of nearly scalding , so I only add a tiny bit of cold water . 
As the tub fills , I get together what I call my bath toys , which consist of my Kindle and an ice cold beer . 
When the tub is full I get my favorite sweat pants and sweatshirt together and , after getting undressed , I slowly lower myself into the tub , savoring every twitch as I lower myself into the scalding water . 
Once I 'm settled , I crack open my beer and then just enjoy the feeling of all of the tension leaving my muscles as I read . 
When the water cools off -LRB- this can take 30 minutes or more -RRB- I get out of the tub , dry off and get dressed , but not without a slight feeling of disappointment that the experience has ended . 
I flew to Iceland one year on vacation . 
I left JFK airport in New York and flew to Keflavik in Iceland . 
JFK is an enormous airport . 
I parked in long term parking and then took a shuttle to actual terminals . 
I felt so nervous that I would n't make my flight ! 
I was so afraid beforehand of getting my bag lost that I just packed everything I needed into a small carry on bag . 
I checked in and then went to security . 
Security moved along quickly and I was waiting at my gate to catch my flight . 
JFK airport is pretty gross ! 
While I was waiting , I had a beer at a restaurant . 
A roach fell on my husband who was with me ! 
We quietly called our server over and she stepped on it and told us it happens all the time ! 
We were so disgusted . 
It actually made us want to get on the plane even quicker and get out of there . 
Finally , we boarded the plane and were seated next to some nice people from Oregon . 
We chatted a bit with them and I watched an in-flight movie of Jane Eyre . 
Finally we got to Iceland . 
I loved flying ! 
My family moved into a new house and we wanted to plant a year to celebrate our new beginning . 
We knew that the tree would grow over the years and would be a great reminder of how long we had lived there . 
We chose a spot in our yard where the tree would have plenty of space to grow . 
My dad brought out some shovels and we all helped to dig a big hole . 
The tree was not very large yet , but the ball of roots at the bottom made it very heavy . 
We all helped Dad lift the tree and carry it over to the hole . 
We placed it in gently , being very careful not to damage the roots or the branches . 
We threw some fertilizer into the hole to feed the tree and then we started to refill the hole with the dirt we had dug out . 
We made sure the tree was nice and straight and standing tall and then began patting down the dirt . 
When it was finished we turned on the hose and gave it plenty of water . 
I begin by making a grocery list of the items I will need to buy at the grocery store . 
Some items are staples and pantry items such as milk and eggs and some are things I want like snacks . 
I visit my favorite grocery store Trader Joes which is walkable from my house in my neighborhood . 
I bring with me my own grocery bags so I can be green and reuse bags for the environment . 
I arrive at the store and get a shopping cart to put my groceries in . 
I start at the aisle with the vegetables and then dairy and then work my way through all the aisles of the grocery store . 
I buy and check off on the items on my grocery list plus more items not on the list of course . 
The store always has new seasonal items so I always manage to buy some of those items . 
I get on line and pay for my groceries at the cash register . 
The cashiers at this store are always so nice with good customer service . 
I pay for everything , leave the store , and bring my groceries home to enjoy . 
Planting a Tree to Bring in Spring A friend gave me a gift . 
She brought me a tree that I could plant in my own yard and enjoy for years to come . 
It was a Douglas fir evergreen tree . 
Spring had come a few weeks before and the temperatures were mild again . 
One sunny day , I decided to plant my tree . 
I planted my tree in my backyard . 
It seemed to be the best place for it . 
I looked forward to when the tree grew and provided shade and beauty to the landscape . 
I was so inspired by planting this tree that I decided that I wanted to plant a few more trees . 
I went to a local nursery and picked out three more varieties of trees that would grow well in my local area . 
I took them home and planted them as long . 
In a few years , my backyard will be even more beautiful than it is today due to the short amount of time that it took me to plant a few trees . 
In September 2012 , I rode and flew in an airplane on my way back home from my parents ' country of birth , the Philippines . 
I rode two different planes , but this one will be about the second one , the trip on the way back to the United States . 
I was in Narita International Airport and boarding my second flight . 
I forgot which airline it was . 
But like one would normally do , I waited in line , showed the boarding attendant my ticket and passport , and headed to the tunnel connecting the building and the plane . 
As I headed for my seat , I tried looking at the seat numbers on the compartments above them . 
I found mine , and opened the compartment to put my carry-on in . 
I sat down and tried to make myself comfortable . 
In about 15 minutes , we were ready for take-off . 
The flight attendant made some announcements , and we were set . 
I was seated by the window , as I always do . 
I love sitting by the window . 
The view is awe-inspiring when you ' re that high . 
I decided to open up a fresh set of earphones and browsed the media player in front of me , and watched Avengers . 
My viewing was interrupted when dinner was being served . 
I love airport food as well , for the most part . 
It ' s not always the best , but most of the time I like it . 
After eating , I finished the movie and fell asleep . 
For the rest of the flight , I saw clouds , sunshine , and other planes , and by nighttime , we landed in New York , at the JFK International airport . 
It was a great flight . 
Last night I decided to take a bath . 
I had been outside playing all day and was really dirty . 
I started running the warm water to fill the bathtub . 
I like the tub to be very full . 
While it was filling , I gathered everything I would need for my bath . 
I got my soap , shampoo , washcloth and towel . 
I also brought my clean bathrobe into the bathroom and hung it on the hook by the door . 
When the tub was full I got in and just soaked for about ten minutes . 
Then I put shampoo in my hair and scrubbed it until it was covered in bubbles . 
I rinsed it off and then used the washcloth and soap to wash my body . 
When I was all clean I got out and dried myself really well with the soft , dry towel . 
I put on my bathrobe and let let the water out of the tub . 
It felt good to be all clean . 
Eliminating Boredom By The Book I had the day off work . 
I was glad of that but only a few hours into my day , I realized how bored I was . 
I had already cleaned my house and done everything I needed to do . 
I turned on the television , but I could n't find anything to watch . 
It was cloudy and rainy outside , so going outside was not the best option . 
I knew I needed to find something to do though and I thought that maybe it would be a great idea to find a new book to read . 
I decided to drive to the local library . 
I looked at all of the new books that they had on display . 
I found a book that really caught my eye and looked intriguing . 
I knew that I really wanted to read this book so I checked it out . 
I went home and started reading . 
The book was so interesting that I read and read and forgot what time it was . 
I was almost to the end of the book when I noticed it was already dark outside . 
I was amazed at how fast time had gone due to being caught up in a very interesting book . 
Going to the library to borrow a book had been a very great idea to cure my boredom . 
Carrying a spare inner tube saves lots of time and trouble , since I have to carry a patch kit anyway . 
However , if I do n't have one , I can still fix a flat . 
First I turn the bike over , and remove the brake by opening the quick release lever . 
Then I remove the tire with its quick release lever . 
Now I inspect the outside of the tire , to try to find the source of the problem . 
I look for imbedded glass , thorns , cuts or tears . 
If I find a foreign object , I remove it . 
Then I take the tire off . 
I deflate it , and push the side of the tire towards the middle , trying to expose the tube . 
If that fails , I use tire irons , if I have them . 
I shove one in on the opposite side of the wheel form the valve , and lever the edge of the tire out of the rim . 
Then I put in the next tire iron about three spokes away and try to lift the section of tire in between up and away from the rim . 
This makes it possible to take the whole tire out and remove it . 
I look for the leak inside the tire , and then on the tube . 
I deflate the tube by pushing the valve center until I hear air hiss . 
If I can not find the leak , I put the tube in a bucket of water and look for bubbles . 
If I can not do that , I listen , and then I look around the valve . 
I also inspect the inside of the tire . 
Now , I need a patch kit . 
I clean the outside of the tire near the leak as much as I can . 
Then I roughen the area with the scratchy thing provided . 
I spread the foul-smelling glue , let it dry until it is tacky , and press on the patch , starting at its center , and being careful not to glue the tire to itself . 
Now I partially re-inflate the tube , and replace it in the tire , making sure the spoke cushion stays in place . 
I put the tire on the wheel , and check to see that the valve is pointed straight to the center . 
I re-inflate the tube , and then replace the wheel and reattach it and reattach the brake . 
And I turn the bike over again and ride . 
I was on spring break from school and decided to come home for the week . 
I did n't have a car so I had to the train . 
I packed a small bag and took a cab to the train station . 
I went up to the window and bought a ticket to my hometown . 
I decided to buy a few snacks and magazines that local vendors were selling while I waited for the train . 
It came time to board the train and I grabbed my things . 
I got on the train and sat down by the window seat so that I can enjoy the view . 
The train announced it 's next destination and started to take off . 
The conductor came down the aisles and was checking everyone 's ticket . 
I had my ticket ready and handed him my ticket when he got to me . 
I got comfortable and started to read a magazine while waiting to arrive at my destination . 
Awhile later the train had arrived at my hometown . 
I got off the train and met my parents outside the train station who came to pick me up . 
I had spent the day planting a tree and needed to take a bath to clean myself and relax those tired muscles . 
I went to the bathroom and turned on the faucet in the bathtub . 
Once the water reached the temperature that I wanted I plugged the drain to fill the bathtub . 
While the tub was filling up I undressed myself and put the dirty soiled clothing in the the hamper . 
I turned the water off and got into the nice hot relaxing tub of water . 
I added some bath soap into the tub and proceeded to scrub the dirt off my body with a washcloth . 
After washing myself and relaxing a bit I unclog the drain and watch the dirty soapy water spiral down the drain . 
I rinse body quickly in the shower to rinse the soap off . 
I get out and grab a towel to dry myself . 
I put on a clean set of clothes and feel fresh . 
I 'd been looking forward to reading Tigerman , the new novel by my favorite writer , Nick Harkaway . 
However , I do n't like paying for the hard cover editions of books , and the paperback version would not be released for another year . 
I therefore decided to walk to my local library and borrow the book . 
To my disappointment , it was already checked out , but I was able to place a hold on the book . 
Six weeks later , the library sent me an e-mail to let me know that Tigerman had been returned and I could now check it out . 
I stopped by on my way home from work that evening , and got the book . 
It was a fun read , but I was not able to finish it by the due date , so I went online and obtained an extension of the due date . 
A few days later , I finished the book , which was wonderful . 
I wanted other people to be able to enjoy it too , so I promptly returned the book to the library . 
For my 13th birthday I decided I 'd bake my own cake instead of having my Mom buy one for me . 
To keep it simple my Mom bought a Betty Crocker cake mix . 
Once my friends arrived we gathered in the kitchen to make the cake . 
The first thing we did was set the stove to the temperature indicated on the box . 
While the stove warmed up I asked my friend Nikki to be in charge of getting things from the fridge while my friend Stephanie went to the cabinets to get whatever I called out that was needed there . 
Once we had the bowls , measuring cups , and liquid ingredients from the fridge we were ready to start mixing . 
Three people making a cake is a bit difficult to do , but we had fun talking while we were doing it and I ended up doing most of it while my friends chatted with me . 
I put the mix in the bowl and added the fresh ingredients . 
We took turns mixing that up and then poured the mix into a cake pan that Nikki greased with some butter . 
I then put the cake into the stove while wearing oven mitts and set the stove 's timer to the suggested baking time on the box . 
While it baked we could n't help spooning out some icing for ourselves . 
So while most people will talk about baking a basic cake out of a box , I am actually going to be writing about re-learning how to bake one from scratch . 
I just found out that I have a gluten intolerance . 
Like , VERY gluten intolerant . 
So , I am re-learning how to do just about everything . 
Most of the time , you can just buy stuff from a box and add some eggs , oil and milk and call it good . 
Well , as there are very few gluten free baking premade box mixes , and even fewer that actually taste good , I have been teaching myself how to bake from scratch . 
All I really have to do is mix and match different flours . 
Wheat flour is sticky and fluffy , but keeps moisture well . 
That is part of the reason so many bake with it . 
If I just use rice flour , that is top dry . 
If I just use coconut flour , well then it all crumbles . 
So , what I do is buy several different kinds of flours so I can mix and match their properties and actually make tasty things that are extremely similar to the real deal . 
After I get the flours combined , I just add the regular ingredients , figure out a baking temperature and stick it in . 
Right now I keep a close eye on the food since there are n't a ton of good recipes out there . 
So far it has worked out well ! 
Last Fourth of July we had a nice family dinner outside . 
Unfortunately the sun was so hot and we had nothing to provide us shade . 
This year I wanted to do something different so I decided to plant a tree right where the table was outside . 
Maybe this year we would have some shade to keep us cool . 
I went to the local farmer , farmer Jack and asked him if he could help me out . 
He told me that I would want to grow a nice oak tree right by that table . 
He was able to give me some seeds to use so I could make my plan happen . 
I used a small gardening tool to dig up some dirt . 
I placed the seeds inside the dirt and then covered it up again . 
I took a watering can and filled it up with water from the hose . 
I watered the dirt where the seeds were and did this every day without fail . 
I 've started to see a tree sprouting and am excited for Fourth of July to get here . 
First , you need to pick out where you want to put your tree . 
You 're going to be digging quite a large hole , so you need to consider a few things . 
First of all , make sure you place your tree where it wo n't mess anything up as it grows . 
You want to put it somewhere where it has plenty of room to grow , with soft dirt . 
Next , you need to gather the tree you 're going to plant as well as a shovel . 
Then you 're going to dig a nice big hole . 
You want the entire roots of the tree to be covered sufficiently in dirt , so make sure it 's plenty big enough . 
Next , you place your tree in it 's hole . 
Position it properly . 
Make sure it 's got plenty of room . 
Finally , you can fill in dirt around your tree . 
Now you 're finished and you can watch your tree grow ! 
Soon you 'll have a nice big tree to shade you ! 
Last summer , I decided to visit my friend Emily . 
She lives very far from me : I live in the middle of the country , and she lives on the coast . 
So , I had to visit by flying there in an airplane . 
I got up very early in the morning so that I could drive to the airport - it was still dark outside when I left my house . 
I parked in the lot , picked up my duffle bag and slung it across my shoulders , and walked into the airport . 
I went to the ticket counter to check in at one of the kiosks , so that the airline knew I would be flying that day , and then I had to go through the security line . 
I was flying on a weekday , so the line was very long with people who were flying for work , even though it was still early in the morning . 
I checked my email while I waited , sent my bags through the x-ray machine , and finally stepped out into the main terminal of the airport . 
It was bright and sunny , with lots of people rushing everywhere . 
I walked over to my gate , and waited for my section of the plane to be called to board . 
The flight crew got to my section , and I walked onto my plane , being careful to hold my bags so that they would n't bump into the people who were already sitting down . 
I put my luggage in the overhead compartments and made sure it was secure so that it would n't fall on anyone , and then I sat down in my assigned seat and put my seatbelt on . 
I pulled out a book I brought with me , and read until the plane was ready to take off . 
I listened to the flight attendant 's safety instructions , and then the plane started to move - with a mighty jerk , the wheels left the ground and we were flying . 
It was very loud with the noise of the engine . 
A few minutes after we took off , the pilot came on the intercom and gave us some details about the weather and our flight time . 
Then , the flight attendants walked past in the aisles with their cart , and offered me a drink . 
I got a cup of coffee , and drank it while I read my book . 
A few hours later , the pilot came on the intercom and let us know we were getting ready to land . 
I put my book away , turned off my phone like the flight attendants asked , and made sure everything was secure . 
The plane landed with a bump . 
After a few minutes of waiting on the ground , a gate opened up , and we were allowed to get up and stretch , and get our bags out of the compartments . 
A few minutes later , I walked off the plane with my bags , and walked out to the waiting area to meet my friend . 
Flying in a plane was an interesting experience . 
We had finally earned enough points to travel to Portland . 
Husband bought the tickets a few months before our trip . 
As the date of departure neared , I began to prepare for the flight and trip . 
I packed our clothes and planned things to do . 
His parents drove us to the fly away and we took a bus from there to the airport . 
We walked up to the airline counter and checked in for the flight . 
We decided to carry our luggage on , since it was n't over sized . 
The lady gave us our boarding passes and we walked over to the line to get through the security checkpoint . 
The line was pretty short , so we made it to the front rather quickly . 
The attendant check our IDs . 
We took off our shoes , husband took off his belt , and we placed our luggage on the x-ray belt . 
He emptied his pockets and we walked through the metal detector . 
Everything went without a hitch and we grabbed our belongings and put our shoes back on . 
We walked to our gate and soon they called for boarding . 
We walked out the door , onto the tarmac , up the stairs to the airplane , into the airplane , put our baggage up in the compartments , and took our seats . 
We held hands as they went over the safety protocol and the plane taxied to take off . 
When it took off , I closed my eyes and soon we were soaring in the air . 
We flew over for a few hours and then had a gentle landing . 
We deplaned and walked into the terminal . 
I needed to get from my house to work , but my car wouldn ' t start . 
I decided my best option was to take the bus . 
I walked down the street to the nearest bus stop that would take me close to work . 
I waited for about five minutes for the bus to come . 
Once I got on , I put my money in the machine and headed towards the back to find a seat . 
There were only three open seats so I took one of them and popped in my ear buds to listen to music . 
I also brought a book along to read so nobody would try to talk to me . 
The bus made three stops before we got to the corner nearest to my work . 
Each time people would get off and as they shuffled past would bump into my knees which was really annoying . 
Then more people would get on and some would find seats , but others had to stand . 
One person stood directly in front of me , in constant contact with my legs . 
This really annoyed me even more . 
I don ' t like riding public transportation . 
Finally we got to my stop and I got out of the bus through the rear doors . 
I needed to write a school report on tigers , and I decided to visit the library to find a book to use in my research . 
When I entered the library , I saw hundreds of books on many different shelves and was not sure where to find books on tigers . 
I asked a librarian for help finding books on tigers . 
Are you looking for stories about tigers , or facts and photographs about tigers ? 
she asked me . 
I told her I wanted facts and real information so I can write a report . 
She walked over to a group of shelves labeled Nonfiction and told me that these books all had true facts and pictures , rather than being imaginary stories . 
They are put in a special order using number codes called the Dewey Decimal System . 
Using these codes , all the books on tigers would be in the same place and would be very close to books about other animals . 
She looked up the Dewey Decimal System code for tigers and wrote it down for me . 
Walking through the shelves with my code , I saw that the numbers on the spines of the books start at zero and keep getting bigger and bigger . 
Finally , I was getting close to the number she wrote down for me . 
There I saw books about lions , cheetahs , and finally tigers . 
I found a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report and brought it back to the librarian . 
She asked me for my library card , and after I handed it to her , she scanned it with her computer . 
Next , she scanned a barcode on the back of the book . 
Now the book was checked out in my name so that the library would know who has the book . 
She handed me the book and told me that I needed to bring it back to the library in two weeks . 
If I did n't bring it back , I would have to pay a fine for every day I kept it , because other people might want to read the book too . 
I thanked her and went home to work on my report . 
Taking a train somewhere can be an old-fashioned way of travel , but it can also be a lot of fun ! 
Train tracks do n't go everywhere anymore and they certainly are n't used as often . 
This can make travel a little bit more difficult . 
I decided to take a train to visit my friend one day . 
I found a great deal on train tickets and decided to travel the country the old-fashioned way . 
I ordered my tickets on a computer and arranged my whole trip . 
I packed up my belongings , just like you would if you were flying a plane - both have a specific departure time ! 
Instead of going to an airport , I showed up at the train station with my luggage and train tickets . 
I stowed away my luggage and handed my ticket over . 
I found a great car with a bed and a shared bathroom and had a very enjoyable train trip ! 
I went into the barber shop . 
There were three barber 's chair lined up along the wall . 
Each one had a customer in it who was already getting a haircut so I had to wait . 
I read a magazine for about five minutes until a customer paid and left . 
The barber called me over , put a smock on me , and asked me how I liked my hair cut . 
I told him I liked it short all over . 
He wet my hair down with a spray bottle of water and then started cutting my hair on the top and sides with scissors . 
After he had thinned it out a bit , he shaved the sides and back with electric clippers . 
Finally , he put hot foam on my neck and used a straight razor to shave my neck and leave a clean neat hairline . 
He showed me how it looked in the mirror and I approved . 
The barber whipped off the smock and I paid him , giving him a tip as well . 
Now I was ready for my big date ! 
I was about to go for a bicycle ride , but when I went to the garage to get my bike I realized the tire was completely flat . 
Luckily I was prepared for just such an event . 
I went to a shelf and found my bicycle repair kit . 
Then I took a close look at the bicycle tire . 
If I could n't find the leak , I could always fill a tub with water , put the tire under the water and see where the bubbles come out . 
Luckily the leak was obvious . 
I applied some adhesive from the kit and put on a rubber patch . 
Then I got down my bicycle pump . 
I hooked the hose up to the nipple on the tire and then pumped up and down vigorously for a few minutes . 
I felt the tire . 
It was nice and firm . 
Success ! 
I put away the pump and kit and hopped on for my bike ride . 
A few years ago I rode the train from Arizona to Washington state . 
It took a long time . 
I purchased my ticket online . 
When it came time to board the train I got a ride from a friend , who dropped me off right next to the tracks . 
I showed my ticket to the train attendant , and he let me aboard the train . 
There was another person on the train who showed me what seat to sit in . 
After everyone had boarded , the train got moving . 
The trip from Arizona to Washington takes a week , with a lot of stops in between . 
The serve food right on the train , but it also stops in a lot of towns where you can get off and eat or buy souvenirs . 
Not much happens while you are on the train , but there is a lot to look out and see from the windows . 
When we finally reached Washington the train conductor made an announcement over the intercom , and I got off at my stop , then went home to my family . 
A couple of nights ago I felt really sick , and one of the things that usually helps me feel better is to take a hot bath . 
So I went into my bathroom and prepared the bath tub . 
First I plugged the drain so the water would n't escape . 
Then I turned on the hot water and let it fill up . 
The process took about five minutes . 
I then tested the water to see how hot it was , because I did n't want to jump right in and burn myself . 
I decided it was a little too hot , so I let it cool for a couple of minutes . 
Once the water was a comfortable temperature I stepped in and laid down in the water . 
I let the warm water sooth my aches and pains and I began to feel better . 
I had n't taken a shower that day , so I decided I should also clean myself while I was in the bath . 
Once that was over I unplugged the drain and dried myself off . 
When I came inside from the cold , I decided to take a hot bath to warm myself up and get clean . 
I put the drain stopper in the tub , and then filled the tub with hot water while I took off my clothes . 
Once I was naked , I eased my way into the tub and let myself sink into the water , I washed my face with a gentle soap , and then rubbed a different soap over my body , making sure to get every part nice and clean . 
When I was done washing myself , I stayed in the tub for another ten or fifteen minutes , and just daydream about swimming in waters near a tropical island . 
I completely forgot that it was winter outside . 
Eventually , I got out of the tub and used a towel to dry my body and my hair . 
I then put on some clean clothes and went to make myself a cup of hot cocoa . 
The only time I have ever planted a tree was as a memorial . 
We had raised the funds to buy the tree . 
Then I went to Home depot to pick out the tree . 
I know nothing about trees , so I had the employee at Home Depot help me . 
She helped me decide the best tree for the area that we were planting it . 
One that would n't need much work or upkeep . 
Then she showed me what else I would need for the tree . 
I bought soil and a shovel . 
We went to the park where we were planting the tree and dug the hole for the tree . 
After we place the tree and put in the supports , we filled the hole back in , packing the soil tight . 
We said a few words and watered the tree . 
Lastly , we put the memorial plaque in front of the tree since it was a memorial for someone who has passed . 
Two years ago was my first and only airplane flight . 
I was moving from the state of Kansas to the state of Washington , permanently . 
I had ordered my tickets three months in advance , with a little bit of hassle due to rescheduling -LRB- it was free , thankfully , -RRB- and met with my parents at the airport . 
After they wished me goodbye I took my luggage to the security area , got cleared ten minutes in advance , and waited for my plane , listening carefully for my number while I played my Nintendo DS . 
After that , we were all filed single line into my plane , and I took a seat - it was an open seated plane - and I waited to take off ! 
It was super shaky due to turbulence but the flight was otherwise a very boring two hours - I fell asleep several times waiting for us to get there , and also ordered soda and a few snacks . 
I was allowed to play my games on the plane as long as it did n't use any wireless networks , but they got boring after a while . 
When I got off , I made sure to grab my carry-on and meet my ride to the new place at the Washington airport ! 
Today , I will go grocery shopping with my six year old grandson . 
Bryan loves to help grandma go to the grocery store . 
Today we will be buying some of Bryan 's favorite foods like cherry tomatoes and grapes . 
We also need milk and bread and some kind of meat for supper . 
We will be making hamburgers for supper so we also need to buy hamburger buns . 
Bryan likes to push the shopping cart but when you are driving the shopping cart you have too look out for other people so you do not bump into them . 
I let Bryan go down the bread isle to find the two things that we need , bread and hamburger buns . 
Bryan likes looking for things on the shelves and putting them in the cart . 
We also go to the meat department to look for the hamburger . 
When we have everything that we need for supper it is time to go to the check-out and pay for our food , Bryan is a big helper by putting the food up on the counter for the cashier so they can see what we have and put it in the bags for us to take home . 
This has been a great adventure going to the store with grandma . 
One of my favorite weekly activities is going grocery shopping . 
Yesterday afternoon I took a casual stroll to my local Whole Foods and could not resist their tempting and rather delicious items . 
My favorite place is the bakery . 
From the warm , freshly baked chocolate chip cookies , to the elaborate berries and cream cakes , there is not a product that does not disappoint . 
Another section I perused was the prepared food section . 
From pizza , tacos , a salad bar , and fried chicken , there was plenty to choose from . 
My eyes wandered to the burrito bar , as I glanced at the grilled chicken , steak and fajita vegetables . 
I ordered a grilled steak burrito stuffed with cheese , hot sauce , salsa , and guacamole . 
After I paid the kind chef who created it , I took one large mammoth bite and dug in . 
It was one of the most delicious burritos I had ever tasted . 
I made sure to definitely come back next time ! 
I have actually planted a few trees in my day . 
I helped my mom plant a few fruit trees that she had bought . 
Interestingly enough , we never leave them in the pot , but we never put them in the ground dirt either . 
We start out by digging a pretty deep hole . 
Depending on the size of the tree and the roots , its usually about a foot and a half deep and about a foot wide . 
we then put soft planting soil in the bottom to make sure that the tree will have more nutrition . 
My mom also has manure that she uses sometimes , but I let her handle that one . 
After we have everything set up , we take the tree out of the pot , and gently spread out the roots to make sure they can grow with some more space . 
Then we stick in in the hole , and put more dirt and whatever around it and gently pack it in . 
After all that , we find a stake of some sort and tie it next to the tree so it has something to keep it upright while it grows . 
How you take a bath varies a bit with what type of bathing facilities you have . 
I 'm going to describe the typical definition of a bath . 
Go to your tub and take the shower curtain out of the tub if it is inside it . 
You do n't want it to get wet ! 
Before you close the drain you should turn on the water and let it run for a little bit so you can get it to the right temperature before you start filling the tub . 
If you have somewhere to store the water you can place a bucket under the warming water and use it for another purpose . 
Conservation ! 
Once the water coming from the tap is at the temperature you like you can place the stopper in the drain and start filling the tub . 
Make sure you do n't fill the tub all the way to the top because the water will displace once you get into the tub . 
You can also get in as the tub is filling so you can make a better judgment about when to turn off the water . 
While you are in the tub you should take a wash cloth and soap or bodywash to give yourself a good scrub down . 
If you need to wash your hair it is often better to do it after your bath . 
You can put the shampoo in your hair and as the tub empties place your head under the faucet to rinse out the soap . 
Enjoy your bath ! 
, This one was a little tough . 
I was n't sure how much detail to go into about taking the bath versus setting up the bath 
Last week I got a phone call for a job interview , and I decided I should clean myself up before going there . 
The major thing I needed to do was get a haircut since my hair had become long and unkempt . 
I went over to the local barber and signed into the waiting list . 
I sat around waiting my turn , which took about 15 minutes . 
When they called my name I got up and sat in the barber chair . 
The barber asked me what kind of haircut I wanted , and I just told them to give me a professional look . 
They were good at their job so they knew exactly what to do . 
The hair cutting process took about 10 minutes to finish , and once it was over I looked in the mirror and was very pleased with the result . 
I went to the front desk and paid , and I also gave the barber a tip . 
Yesterday , as I pulled my bicycle out of the garage , I realized it had a flat tire . 
So , I prepared to repair it . 
First , I went to the tool box and got out the wrench and other necessary tools . 
Then , I realized I did n't have a new bike tire . 
So , I opened the door to my car and got in . 
I drove to the nearest bicycle shop and bought two new bicycle tires -- one for now and one for later . 
I drove back home where the bicycle was waiting for me . 
I took the old , flat tire off of the bicycle using my wrench to loosen the screws and other mechanical devices . 
I then stretched the new tire out over the wheel and affixed it . 
I twirled it around and tested it to make sure that it was properly fastened . 
Next , I drove around the driveway to make sure that it would hold . 
Sure enough , it was secure and ready for me to go on my bike ride . 
Borrowing a book from the library is a big responsibility . 
I got my first library card when I was in middle school . 
I could go right down the street from my house and explore everything the library had to offer . 
My library has books , magazines , computers , movies , anything I need . 
I was searching for a book around Halloween that had some fun ghost stories . 
My library had the exact book I wanted ! 
The library also had some others . 
I sat around a table with my pile of books and looked through them . 
Finally , I could n't resist and I went to the counter with the book I had come there for . 
The librarian was really nice as she took my card and typed into her computer . 
I checked the book out for two weeks . 
This would give me plenty of time to enjoy it and best of all , the librarian let me know I could check it out for even longer if I needed to . 
I would just have to bring the book back on the due date and have it scanned out again . 
I took great care of my book and returned it on time . 
Libraries provide a great service to me and my community and I 'm thankful I can go there and always find what I want to read . 
In order to borrow a book from the library , I will check to be sure I have my library card on me , in my purse . 
I drive to the local library and park my car . 
I walk into the library and head to where the books to check out are located . 
I head over there and start to look for the book I am interested in borrowing . 
If I am having a problem finding the book , I will go to the information desk and ask for help . 
Sometimes , it is hard to find for me to find a book on my own in the library , since they have a coding system that is sometimes confusing to me . 
I either find my book available , or find that it is checked out . 
If it is available , I get my library card out and head to the check out section of the library . 
If it is n't available , I will ask as to when it will be . 
I leave the library , get in my car and drive home to enjoy my borrowed book . 
Yesterday was a long and stressful day . 
From start to finish , it felt like nothing could possibly go right . 
On days like those , I really love a nice bubble bath to relax and wash off the stress , so that is what I did . 
I gathered up a towel , body wash , shampoo , conditioner , bubble bath and a few candles and walked into my bathroom to take a nice , long bath . 
I lit the cinnamon-scented candles , turned on the water to make sure it would be warm before I stepped in , then I dropped a little bit of the bubble bath in the water to create a gentle lather . 
I sank into the bubbles and took a deep breath . 
It felt amazing to get to relax after such a rough day . 
The candles made the whole bathroom smell great and the water was awesome on my skin . 
Finally , I shampooed my hair and washed myself , then toweled off and put on my pajamas to get ready for bed . 
Two weeks ago I went on a vacation to Florida . 
Getting there meant having to fly in an airplane ! 
I arranged for a friend to drive me to the airport , and drop me off at the door near check in . 
I pulled a suitcase on wheels behind me and swung my small carry on bag over my shoulder . 
Once inside I followed signs and made my way to my airlines luggage drop off area . 
A man weight my suitcase , put a sticker on it , and whisked it out of my sight . 
Then I printed a boarding pass and made my way to the security line . 
There I waited until my turn , showed the security agent my ID card and went to the walk through metal detector . 
Finally , I could make my way to my gate where I waited to be called to board . 
Once on board the plane I found my seat number and settled in comfortably . 
Before I knew it we were in the air . 
A flight attendant gave me a soda , and I relaxed watching a movie until we finally landed in Florida three hours later . 
I am an avid gardener . 
I have a large garden and lots of flower beds . 
But this year I wanted to plant some small fruit trees in my garden . 
I went to the nursery and picked out a small dwarf apple tree I wanted to plant . 
The tree was young and was basically a very small trunk with two branches . 
I brought it home and read the instructions for planting it . 
The whole I needed to dig was 18 inches across and 1 foot deep . 
I used my garden shovel to break up the grass and dig the hole . 
I saved the dirt in my wheelbarrow to put back in the whole when I was done . 
I put the small tree in the whole and filled the hole with water . 
When the water had saturated the earth I then shoveled thew leftover dirt back in the hole . 
I was finished in about 15 mintes . 
I think I will get several more fruit trees to plant . 
It was very easy to do . 
My friends birthday was tomorrow and I wanted to do something special for her . 
Aside from just getting her a gift I decided to make her a special cake . 
This cake was going to be shaped like a heart and it would be chocolate , her favorite flavor . 
I headed to the grocery store to get my ingredients . 
I got butter , unsweetened chocolate , sugar , eggs , flour , baking soda , salt , milk , and vinegar . 
I was making a devil 's food cake , something simple and yet elegant . 
When I got home I preheated the oven to 350 degrees F and I grease up my pans , I was going to be working hard tonight . 
I then melted 1\/2 cup of butter and 1 ounce of chocolate in a small pan , once it had melted I set it aside to cool down . 
So far so good . 
Next I mixed 2 eggs with 2 cups of white sugar and I added the chocolate mixture . 
After that I added 1 cup of boiled water and I made sure to blend it well , the mixture was very liquid like , just like it needed to be . 
After that I mixed in my 2 1/4 cups of flour , 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda , and 1/4 teaspoons of salt . 
I blended this new mixture well . 
I am really the best boyfriend in the world . 
After that I mixed in 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 1\/4 cup of milk to the main mixture . 
The main process was done all I needed to do was to bake it for 30 minutes , cut it into shape , and frost the cake . 
Her birthday tomorrow was going to be very special . 
Last week was my friend 's birthday . 
I asked him if he was going to do anything special and he said no . 
I felt bad for him , so I said I would at least bake him a cake . 
Maybe this was a hasty decision since I have no experience baking cakes . 
So I looked online to see what I needed to do . 
I found a recipe that looked easy enough , so later that day I drove over to the grocery store to buy all the ingredients I would need to bake the cake . 
When I got to the store I started gathering up everything I needed . 
Once I almost had everything I turned down an aisle and noticed there were boxed of pre-made cake mix I could buy . 
This seemed like an easy option , so I put all the ingredients back and bought one of those mixes . 
I got home and started baking . 
All I needed to add to the mix was a couple eggs and some vegetable oil . 
After it was in the oven for an hour the cake was ready . 
When I went grocery shopping I started by looking in my refrigerator and figuring out what I needed to get . 
I made a shopping list based on this . 
Then I decided which store was the best to go to to buy these items . 
I decided that Publix was the best and closest store for me . 
I walked to the store with my empty backpack , and when I got in the first thing I did was check the clearance section and sales . 
After that I walked the aisle , making sure to pick up everything that I needed . 
I avoided using a shopping cart to be sure that I would not buy more than I could carry . 
After picking up all the items I went to the checkout where I paid for my purchases in cash . 
After that I put the items in my backpack and walked out of the store and back to my house . 
My wife decided she wanted to go to the beach last summer . 
We decided the best way to get there would be an airplane . 
We booked the tickets 3 months in advance to ensure we would have tickets to board the plane to take us to our vacation destination . 
When the day finally came fly on the airplane , we made sure we arrived at least an hour and a half early . 
There are many delays before you actually get on board an airplane . 
First , , you have to go through a metal detector and wait in long lines just to get to the metal detectors . 
Then you have to check your luggage . 
After that , you have to go to the terminal and provide proof of a ticket . 
Once you get on an airplane , you have to prepare for turbulence . 
Other than that , flying on an airplane is a safe and efficient way to travel . 
When we landed , we went straight to the beach . 
Yesterday we got to ride the bus downtown to the Fisherman 's Wharf . 
Before we left , we checked the schedule to see what bus we should take and what time it would pick up . 
10 minutes before the bus was scheduled to pick up in our area , we walked to the street corner and stopped in front of the '' `` Bus Stop '' '' sign . 
We were going to take bus 
Upon entering my local hair salon , I was greeted by a stylist . 
She took my name and told me that I would be next to receive a haircut , because no other customers were in line before me . 
I waited in a chair for several minutes , then she called my name and led me to the chair in which I would get my hair cut . 
The stylist introduced herself and asked how I would like my hair cut . 
I described how I would like my hair cut and she showed that she understood . 
Then , the stylist covered me with a cape to keep hair from getting on my clothes . 
She then sprayed my hair with water to wet it and quickly combed my hair , preparing it to be cut . 
Now we were ready to cut my hair . 
With scissors , she cut my hair in sections , starting at the front and working toward the back . 
She used her skills to cut my hair to match what I described to her earlier . 
Once she was finished , she used electric clippers to shave my neckline and shape the back of my hair . 
Once the haircut was complete , she used a blow drier to remove the cut hair and then removed the cape . 
Finally , she led me to the cash register , where I paid her for her services and thanked her for her time . 
I then exited the shop with a fresh haircut . 
To be honest , when ever I have a flat tire on anything , I usually leave it to my husband , but he did teach me how to fix a flat on a bike . 
Sometimes , it needs a new inner tube . 
If that is the issue , you must remove the outer rubber , and take off the old broken inner tube . 
Then , put on the new one , out the rubber back on , and fill the tire with air . 
Make sure that you check the pressure when filling the tire so as to not put too much air in . 
Sometimes you will also need to chance the outer tire as that may have a hole . 
It can be hard to determine which part of the tire is the issue when you have a flat . 
First , you can check the tire pressure and fill it if low . 
If it quickly loses pressure again , then it was n't just an issue with the tire pressure and you need to replace one of the tire pieces a s previously stated . 
'' After playing football with my friends , I was all sweaty and dirty , so I decide I should take a bath . 
First I made sure there were clean towels available and enough soap and shampoo to thoroughly clean my skin and hair . 
I put the plug in the bottom of the bath tub and turned on the water , being careful to adjust the water to a nice warm , but no too hot , temperature . 
I used my finger to determine just the right temperature . 
After removing my clothes and placing them in the hamper , I carefully stepped into the tub , being sure to steady myself as I entered . 
I gingerly lowered myself into the nice warm water and immediately began to relax . 
After a few minutes of rest and relaxation , I got out the soap and thoroughly washed my whole body , making sure to get all of the dirt and grass stains off that I had accumulated from playing football . 
Next I washed my hair with shampoo and laid back into the water to really rinse it out well . 
I carefully exited the bath tub , making sure to step onto the bath mat so I would n't slip on the smooth floor tiles , and got a towel and dried myself off . 
Now my bath was complete and I felt so nice and clean ! 
What a great feeling ! 
After touring the city , I arrived at the public bus stop and took a seat on the bench waiting for the bus to arrive . 
I looked at a map on what this bus 's route was , and it was heading towards where I needed to go . 
Since I am easily bored , I brought my MP3 player with me to listen to music . 
After a 10 minute wait the bus arrived and I got on with another person . 
As I walked up on the bus , I paid the fee that is required since I do n't have a bus pass . 
Since most people in the city like to keep to themselves , I left them alone and found an open seat on the bus in the back . 
After about 20 minutes on the bus , they finally arrived at my destination spot and I got off . 
After getting off the bus , I walked a couple more blocks over to where my hotel was . 
Yesterday I went grocery shopping . 
I took my grocery list with me , along with some reusable shopping bags . 
My grocery list has all the items I want to buy on it . 
I selected a shopping cart from in front of the store , and went inside . 
I put my reusable bags in the cart . 
I looked at my list and started in the produce section . 
I put different vegetables and fruits into my cart . 
Next I wheeled my cart to the cereal aisle and took a box of cereal . 
I went through the store aisle by aisle and selected my groceries . 
Each aisle is organized by types of food and non-food items . 
One aisle has dried pasta , canned tomatoes , rice , and sauce . 
I selected a few boxes of pasta and some rice . 
Another aisle carries plastic wrap , trash bags , and aluminum foil . 
As I went through the store , I kept looking at my list to see what I needed next . 
When I added each item to my cart , I crossed it off my list . 
My last stop was the dairy aisle where I got milk and eggs . 
When I had all the groceries I wanted , I went to the cash register ans stood in line . 
When it was my turn , I put each item on the conveyor belt and the cashier scanned each one . 
A bagger put all of the groceries into my reusable bags . 
I paid , and then the cashier gave me a receipt . 
I loaded the bags of groceries into the trunk of my car and drove home . 
Last Friday , I went grocery shopping as I do every Friday . 
The first thing I did was looked around the house to see what all I needed from the grocery store . 
I always make a list to make sure I do n't forget anything . 
I went to the grocery store about lunch time . 
When I got to the store , I made sure I had my list and money and got out of my car . 
I went in and got a buggy . 
As I went through the store , I got things on my list to last me through the week . 
I put things like fruit , milk , bread , eggs , and snacks in my buggy . 
I also got some things that I can make meals with , like meat , vegetables , and macaroni and cheese . 
When I was done getting everything on the list , I headed to the front of the store . 
There was a line at the cash register , so I got in line to wait my turn . 
Once it was my turn , I put all of my items onto the counter for the cashier to ring up . 
She was a very sweet young girl and made conversation while ringing up my groceries . 
After she rung up and scanned everything , I paid her and got my things back into my buggy . 
Then I was all done ! 
I headed to the car to put my groceries in the trunk and return the buggy . 
It was a nice and quick grocery trip . 
It was my friend Riley 's birthday and I wanted to do something special for her this year . 
I usually buy her a birthday cake but this year I wanted to do something different . 
I was n't too sure how to make a cake but I decided to try a recipe I saw in a magazine . 
The day before I had purchased all of the ingredients including cake mix , eggs , and strawberries . 
I started off by cracking the eggs and putting it in a large bowl . 
I mixed in sugar and the cake mix according to the instructions . 
The instructions said to bake the whole mix in the oven for a couple of hours . 
When the cake was ready , I put on my oven mitts and removed it from the oven . 
It looked so good but one thing was missing . 
i went into the refrigerator and pulled out six fresh strawberries and placed them on top . 
Riley will love it ! 
Last year I went to visit my cousins in California . 
Since I live in New York , I had to fly in an airplane to get there . 
I purchased a ticket at the ticket counter and then went to the gate where I would get onto the airplane . 
I listened carefully for the announcement that boarding would begin and was first in line to get on . 
Once I was on the plane , I put my suitcase in the overhead compartment and found my seat . 
I had chosen a seat near the window so that I could easily see the clouds and the cities below me . 
I sat down and put my seat belt on . 
Before the flight could take off a flight attendant had to give some important safety instructions . 
I listened carefully so that I would know what to do in an emergency . 
Then I sat back and waited for the plane to take off . 
I was surprised by how loud the engines were when the plane started moving . 
When it took off and rose up into the air , I was so excited I could hardly stand it . 
This was going to be fun ! 
I live in a large city , and while I do have a car , sometimes there is a lack of parking where I need to go . 
When this happens or if I think it will be hard to park , I will take the city bus . 
They have a very good bus service in our city , and you can get wherever you need to be fairly easily and quickly . 
I know riding the bus can be confusing at first , but they make some very easy bus schedules to help people . 
I knew where I needed to go , so I took out my bus schedule and found out when the bus I needed to ride would be at the stop near my house . 
I went there a few minutes early , and right on time , I saw the bus I needed to ride . 
I could tell it was my bus by the big number flashing near the top of the bus . 
When the bus stopped , I got on and put my money into the coin taker which is near the driver . 
I then moved to the back of the bus and chose a seat . 
A nice woman was sitting across from me and she smiled and said hello . 
I smiled and said hello in return . 
People are usually very friendly on the bus . 
I rode the bus for several more stops , and then saw my stop coming up . 
When the bus stopped , I got off the bus and went to my destination . 
It is very easy and convenient to ride the public bus . 
Yesterday I went to the library to borrow a book . 
I was interested in learning more about birdwatching so I thought the library would be a great resource . 
I asked the librarian where the books on nature and birds were . 
She told me the call numbers of the aisle and I went to that aisle . 
Each book had a small sticker on the spine indicating the call number . 
The books are organized by subject , so reading the call numbers is helpful for finding things . 
I browsed through the books on birds . 
I picked one up and flipped through it . 
It had a lot of beautiful photos and interesting facts and tips for watching birds . 
I decided this would be a great book to start with . 
I brought my book to the circulation desk and waited in line . 
When it was my turn , I handed the librarian my library card . 
She scanned the book , opened up the flap , and stamped the due date on the inner card . 
I 'd be able to borrow the book for three weeks . 
When the due date came , I would return it to the front desk or the book drop box . 
I bought a ticket for a train ride to the city . 
I made sure I was at the station at least 15 minutes early so that I would not miss the train . 
After waiting for a few minutes , my train was ready to be boarded . 
I lined up with the other passengers and gave my ticket to the lady at the counter . 
We all boarded the train in an orderly fashion and waited until it was time to depart . 
It was n't too long until it was time for the train to go . 
I quietly sat by the window seat and looked at the great scenery outside as the train went by . 
I would have never seen some of the scenery had I not taken the train . 
Before I knew it , the train had arrived at our destination in the city . 
I am glad I decided to take the train this time because I enjoyed it . 
Yesterday on my way home from work I heard a loud popping noise and nearly lost control of my bicycle . 
After coming to a stop I noticed that my tire was flat . 
I ended up having to walk my bike the rest of the way home as I did not have any tools to repair the tire on the spot . 
Once I returned home I found a can of spray foam that I thought might do the trick if I sprayed it into the tire . 
I sprayed the foam in and it filled the inside walls of the tire . 
I was happy with my ingenuity , although I knew this was only a temporary fix and I should probably replace the tire . 
After the tire was filled I hopped on and rode to my local bike shop where I purchased a replacement tire to put on my bike at a later date . 
Last Saturday , I went to get my hair cut at my favorite hair salon . 
I walked into the salon , told the girl at the desk why I was there , and sat down in one of their comfy chairs to wait . 
I browsed through magazines while I waited . 
My hair stylist walked up and told me she was ready . 
She took me to her chair , I sat down and we talked about what I wanted done that day . 
Then she walked me over to the hair washing station . 
I sat down and leaned my head back and she washed my hair with warm water and really nice smelling shampoo . 
When she was done , she towel dried my hair and we walked back to her station . 
I sat down , she put a cape around me to catch the hair she cuts . 
And she began to cut my hair . 
When she finished she blew it dry and asked me how I liked it . 
I loved it . 
So we walked over to the desk , I paid my bill , left her a tip , and left the salon . 
The library is one of my favorite places on earth ! 
My Mom takes us to the library at least once a week . 
I like reading so much that my Mom asked the librarian to give me an adult library card so I could check out more books . 
The kids card only allows you to check out two books a week , and only from the children 's room . 
The adult card gives me all access -LRB- at the librarian 's discretion my mom said -RRB- and six books a week ! 
When I get to the library I like to browse the new releases shelves . 
Sometimes I ask the librarian for a suggestion . 
If I have a specific topic I want to read I might do a search on the computer . 
Once I have the books I want I take them up to the librarian along with my library card and she checks me out , reminding me of when the books are due . 
It was a hard day , so I looked forward to making myself the perfect bath . 
I get home from work and head straight for the bathtub . 
I run the water until it 's the perfect temperature and plug the drain to allow the water to fill the tub . 
I take some bath salts and oils to drizzle underneath the stream of water to allow it to dissolve and it fills the room with gentle fragrance . 
As the tub continues to fill with water , I grab some candles and carefully place them around the tub . 
After lighting the candles and setting up a towel and robe for getting out , I put on some quiet music to drown out the sound of my husband 's hockey game . 
I grab a small towel to use as a pillow for my neck and finally get in the bath . 
I feel like I 'm melting as I shut my eyes and allow myself to relax . 
I do n't realize how long I 'm in there until I open my eyes and see my husband standing over me . 
The water has lost all its warmth . 
He had put the towel in the dryer and it was now warm , fluffy , and welcoming . 
I step out of the day as my troubles swirl down the drain . 
Before I go grocery shopping I make a list . 
I actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever I know I am out or low on something . 
I try to only go once a week unless there is something I really need for a specific meal . 
I take my electronic list with me to the store , but I often still walk up and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that I might want to try . 
I like to keep a rough estimate of how much I am buying by rounding up . 
So if a can of soup is $ 1.50 I think $ 2 and keep adding that as I shop if I 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget . 
Once I have all my items in my cart I go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it . 
I do n't like to jump lines if one line seems to be moving faster . 
Good to have a little bit of patience . 
I try to remember to bring my bags with me so that I 'm not always getting plastic bags . 
My family recently moved to a new home with a bland and boring yard . 
We decided to plant some trees to spice up the place , so my mother , father , siblings and I all packed ourselves into the SUV and drove to a nearby nursery . 
We looked at many different types of trees before settling on the apple trees . 
We bought several baby apple trees and took them home for planting . 
First , my father and older brother dug large holes in the ground . 
I wanted to help , but they said I was too young to hold the shovel ! 
After the holes were dug , the apple trees were placed inside . 
Then , we shoveled dirt into the holes to fix the apple trees in place . 
I was allowed to help with that , thankfully . 
After all that , our baby apple trees were planted in the ground and we were all very excited to see what they would look like as they grew up . 
Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . 
I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . 
He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . 
I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . 
I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . 
I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . 
I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . 
I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . 
I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . 
After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . 
I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' 
I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle . 
My nephew was very happy when he saw the cake . 
He was very surprised that I had baked a cake for him . 
I wanted to take a trip to see my friends . 
Since they lived far away I decided to fly in an airplane to go see them . 
I went to an online website for the airline to book my flight . 
I chose a window seat so I could enjoy the scenery on the flight . 
After booking my flight I packed my suitcase with what I would need for my flight that left tomorrow . 
The very next day I woke up and got dressed . 
I wore loose fitting clothes that would be comfortable on the flights . 
I wore shoes that I could take off easily to get through security and a belt with no metal in it , again so I could get through security easier . 
I went to the airport with my suitcase and went to the ticket counter . 
I gave them my ID card and they printed my ticket for me . 
I gave them my suitcase and they tagged it for me and gave me a baggage claim ticket . 
I then went through security . 
After making it through secutity I went to my gate and waited until I was told it was time to board the plane . 
I got on the plane in my window seat . 
I listed to the stewardess as she showed me how to buckle my seatbelt and the planes safety features . 
Before I kew it we took off , and I was flying in a plane and enjoying the scenery below . 
I usually do n't take the bus to work but today I decided to give it a try since the bus stop is right across the street from my house . 
When the bus came I greeted the bus driver with a friendly hello and paid my bus fare . 
I was lucky enough to find a seat all the way in the back . 
There was a lot of different people on the bus , some were kids going to school others were adults going to work like I was . 
I watched the bus come to a stop every few blocks and drop off a few people , but for every person that left a new person got on . 
I noticed my stop was near so I pushed the strip on the wall that notifies the bus driver my stop is coming up . 
When he pulled into the next stop I exited the back of the bus and was happy that after 15 minutes I finally reached my destination . 
In order for a bike to be rideable , its tires must be full of air . 
If you ride over a sharp thorn or rock , you might get unlucky , and pierce one of your tires . 
The air will rush out of the hole , and you will have a flat tire , often just called , a flat . 
If this happens , you mus n't continue to ride ; you need to stop somewhere , and repair the tire . 
First , you 'll need to remove the wheel that has the flat tire . 
It is usually easier to remove the front wheel than the back , because of the gears in back . 
Once you have the damaged wheel off the bike , you need to remove the tough outer part of the tire by prying it , little by little , off of the rim of the wheel . 
The hole in the tough tire is not actually the problem ; it 's the hole in the inner tube that must be repaired . 
Once you 've pried the tire off the rim , it is easy to pull out the floppy tube . 
Now you have to locate the hole . 
Sometimes the hole is very obvious , just by looking . 
Other times , you can submerge the tube under water , and look for bubbles . 
Once found , the hole can be easily patched using a patch kit . 
Test to make sure the hole is totally sealed before reassembling the wheel ! 
If the repaired tube holds air well , you can put the tube in the tire , and get them back onto the rim of the wheel . 
Now , pedal fast , to make up for lost time ! 
My husband and I are huge health junkies . 
We ride our bikes to and from work everyday . 
Yes , we own a car but we love getting that extra thirty minute workout everyday . 
Last week , I rode over a piece of cracked glass from a bottle . 
The tire on my bike slowly began to deflate . 
I called my husband to come get me and we took the bike home to get fixed . 
I washed it with soapy water to see where the hole was . 
I got out my air pump and began to pump . 
The part where there was a hole blew out air around the wet wheel . 
I got a bike patch and just stuff it on over the spot once the wheel had dried . 
Put some more air into the tire and test drove it around the street and back . 
My sweet bicycle was back and even better than ever . 
I was excited because I was finally going to visit my friends in Long Island . 
Whenever I thought about Long Island , I always thought about Great Gatsby and the wonderful homes that surrounded that area . 
When the day came to visit them , I boarded a subway train to Penn Station . 
Once I arrived at Penn Station , I looked for a machine that sold tickets . 
I found a machine and bought a one way train ride to Montauk . 
It costed me about 10 dollars . 
Once I bought the ticket , I looked at the schedule board on the wall to see when my train would arrive and what track number it was located on . 
It said that the train was arriving in 2 minutes , and the track number was 16 . 
I found track number 16 and waited for the train to arrive . 
Once it did , I simply waited for the doors to open and got on . 
The seats were super comfortable and I found a empty seat by the window . 
When the train started moving , a conductor came around collecting our tickets . 
Someone forgot to buy a ticket and had to pay extra money to buy one . 
Apparently , tickets are more expensive on the train . 
Once I reached my destination after 1 hour , I finally got off and went off to visit my friends . 
Everytime I get my haircut , I have terrible anxiety . 
I got a really really bad haircut once and never got over it . 
When I get a haircut , first I research different haircuts and styles that I might like and compile a bunch that I like . 
Then I make my appointment with a trusted hairstylist . 
The day of I drive to the hair salon and give my name . 
I wait while for a bit and then they bring me to the back to wash my hair . 
Once done , I see the hair stylist and I show her my pictures . 
While she brushes out my washed hair , we make a decision as to what cut and style will look best on me . 
Then she gets to cutting my hair . 
Once she is done cutting , she dries and styles my hair and checks that it is to my liking . 
Small change are made , and then I tip her , pay my bill , and go home . 
The last time I wanted to borrow a book from the library I was in a different town than my home town . 
I talked to the librarian about this and he told me that it was possible for me to obtain a guest pass , though this would only allow me to take out two books at a time . 
Since this was my only option I decided I would take it . 
I filled out the form , providing my name and address , and showed him my identification card , and I was given a library card . 
I used the card to pick up two books : a collection of poetry and the book Hylozoic by Rudy Rucker . 
The librarian told me that I had to return the books within the space of three weeks , so as soon as I returned to my house I began to read them immediately . 
After I was done with the books I returned them to the library . 
Yesterday , I got ready to take a bath because I had a long stressful day . 
I started running the water and made sure it was just the right temperature . 
I did n't want the tub too hot or too cold . 
Just perfect was what I needed . 
After getting the bath tub to the required temperature . 
I put some bubbles in it to make it extra fun ! 
I hopped in the bath tub and soaked in it for quite some time while reading a nice book . 
It was a great relief to a very long day . 
I love taking baths at the end of the day to unwind . 
After a twenty minutes , or so , it was time to hop out and get dried off . 
I grabbed my towel that was just recently washed , and dried myself off . 
I felt a great deal of relief being nice and clean and ready to go for the rest of the night ! 
Flying in an airplane is a great way to see someone in a far away place . 
I search my tickets online , either by going through a third party company like CheapOFlights or going to the flight company 's website directly , like Delta.com . 
I find the best prices for the date and time I would like to leave my place of origin and land at my destination . 
I find that it is cheaper to do it at least two weeks ahead of time for the best price . 
Within a week of my flight I prepare by packing my clothes and any other necessary items in a maximum of two bags . 
The day of the flight I strive to get to the airport two hours before my flight is scheduled to leave . 
Once I am at the airport I park , then bring my luggage through checkout and confirm and receive my ticket . 
After checkout I get checked by security . 
Afterwards I go to my gate and wait for my plane to load when they call my seat section listed on my flight ticket . 
Once in the plane , I either sleep , read a book , or listen to music when the pilot okays it . 
It is a very safe and fun experience ! 
Baking a cake can be a lot of fun . 
Plus , at the end , you have a yummy cake to eat ! 
First , decide what kind of cake to make . 
Do you have a recipe written down ? 
A recipe is a set of instructions for making a particular cake . 
Make sure to read the recipe all the way through before you start , so there are no surprises ! 
Then gather all your ingredients together : flour , sugar , eggs , and whatever else your recipe says . 
Next , you need to pre-heat the oven . 
Your recipe will tell you what temperature to use . 
While the oven heats up , you mix your ingredients in a big bowl . 
Next , you need to prepare the baking pans . 
Look again at the recipe . 
It will tell you what size pan to use , and whether it needs to be greased . 
To grease a pan means to put a thin layer of shortening or butter on the bottom and sides , so the cake wo n't stick . 
You 'll use two pans if you 're making a layered cake . 
When the pan or pans are ready , pour in the well-mixed ingredients . 
Check if the oven is hot enough -- has it reached the temperature you set it to yet ? 
If so , slide your pan right into the middle of the oven , and close it up . 
The recipe will say how many minutes it will take for the cake to bake . 
It 's a good idea to set a timer , because you do n't want to forget about it , and have a burnt cake , after all your hard work ! 
While the cake cooks , it 's a good idea to clean up the kitchen . 
You 're almost there ! 
When your timer goes off , you can check if the cake is done by sticking a toothpick into the middle . 
If the toothpick comes out dry , and not gooey , your cake is done . 
Turn off the oven , and carefully remove the hot cake with oven mitts on . 
Unfortunately , now you have to leave it alone until it cools . 
When it 's cooled , turn it out of the pan , and put the frosting on , if your cake is a frosted cake . 
Next is the best part : slice that cake into eight , put a slice on a plate , and enjoy ! 
Today my sweat tooth is acting up . 
I think a good cake is in order for myself and my family to enjoy as dessert after supper . 
I scan my cabinets for the ingredients and realize that a trip to the store is in order to get what I require . 
After a fast trip to the local store i have everything I need for a delicious pineapple upside down cake . 
Butter , mix , fresh pineapple , cherries , yum , yum ! 
Now time to get the oven preheated and mix the stuff up and get it ready to bake . 
Twenty minutes later a delicious cake goes into the oven and another 45 minutes later a wonderful smelling masterpiece comes out of it . 
Ten minutes to cool slightly and then flip it over onto a board to finish cooling . 
I sneak a taste from one corner and find it is as delicious as it looks and smells . 
If you want to plant a tree it is best to get a small sapling . 
Dig yourself a hole and put the saplings root ball in the hole . 
You do not want to cut or break the roots when you put it in the ground . 
Make sure your hole is big enough but not too deep . 
You also do not want your hole to be too narrow . 
You can remove any dead or dried up roots from the ball . 
You now want to refill with dirt lightly tamping the dirt as you go . 
Make a mound of dirt around the base of the tree with the dirt that no longer fits in the hole . 
Water the tree . 
It is a good idea to also add some sort of mulch to protect the dirt from washing away . 
This will also help keep weeds from growing and help in keeping moisture to roots . 
Fertilize and water your newly planted tree .
