I flew on an airplane about 2 months ago . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I was going from Chicago to Los Angeles . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
It was a very early flight . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
My brother was able to drop me off at the airport . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I had already checked in online the night before and had no bags to check , so I walked straight to the security line . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Once TSA checked my ID and boarding pass , I stood in line for about 10 minutes while I waited for my bags\/body to be scanned . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
Once through security , I checked the monitors to see that my flight was on time and that there was not a last minute gate change . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I then walked to the gate and boarded the plane about 10 minutes later . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
The flight attendants went over the safety procedures , the captain gave his greetings , and we were on our way . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
The flight was very smooth and quiet . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The time flew by , as I slept most of the way . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We landed on time . 	1 0 0 1 0
The plane then taxied to the gate and everyone exited the plane . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Another successful flight . 	0 0 1 0
Last week , I decided to take a nice relaxing bubble bath after a hard day of work . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After getting done with my chores , I went up stairs into the bedroom to grab some clothes . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After finding on what I wanted to wear , I went into the bathroom and shut the door . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I went to the bath tub , and turned on the faucet . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I messed around with the knobs on the faucet to get some hot water that was perfect temperature . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
After I found the perfect temperature I then plug the drain and then put a small amount of bubble bath into the tub . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
While I am waiting for the water to raise , I take off my clothes and put them into the laundry basket . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
After the water is at an acceptable level , I turn off the faucet completely . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I then turn some music on , and sit down in the tub and relax for a while . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I get a washcloth and clean myself up everywhere . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
After I am done I then get up and dry myself off with a towel and drain the water . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After I am dried I put my new clothes on and clean up the bathroom . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I woke up this morning and decided to go get my haircut . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I normally go to a place that calls for a phone call in advance of arriving but this time I decided to go to a different place where I could just walk in . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
When I arrived I had to wait for about 10 minutes before someone could cut my hair , which was alright with me since I did not make an appointment or anything . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I got in the chair the lady cutting my hair asked me what kind of haircut I wanted and I told her short hair on the top with a buzz cut on the sides . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
She told me that would be a great look for me and I agreed . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
During the hair cut I talked to the barber about what I did in life and asked her some questions as well . 	0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
After about 10 minutes she finished the job . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I tipped her 5 dollars for her effort and went off satisfied with my haircut . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
It was a good experience . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
To go on a train ride to Chicago , I had to have a ticket . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It is possible to buy tickets online , but it was fun to go to the train station to get them . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
At the train station , I got in line and waited my turn . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
When I got to the window , I told the station agent where I wanted to go , when , and what kind of ticket I wanted . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
She told me how much I had to pay . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
You can pay with cash , but I paid by credit card . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
It is a long trip , so I had to show my identification as well . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
Since I was going in an hour , I waited for the train . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
You can wait in the station , but I waited on the platform . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The ticket will tell which platform you want . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
The train arrived at the platform in plenty of time for everyone to get on board . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
As I got on , I showed my ticket to the conductor , but kept it . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I found myself a nice seat . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Usually , young able-bodied people will take the upstairs seats , and leave the downstairs seats for people who want to sit down right away . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Soon after I took my seat , I heard someone outside call , All aboard ! 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
There was a gentle chugging sound as the train slowly got underway . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The conductor soon came and took my ticket , and fastened up a card with my destination by my seat . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
Now I was free to roam about the train , looking out the windows and watching the countryside fly by . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Each stop was announced over the P.A. system well in advance , so I knew just when to get off the train . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I heard Chicago announced , I went downstairs to wait with the other people who were getting off there . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We were all standing up , so we hung on tight . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
When the train doors opened , we stepped down carefully onto the platform in Chicago . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Today I hopped on my bike to take a ride to the supermarket . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When I sat down , I noticed my tire was flat . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I looked down , and sure enough there was no air in the tire . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I went to go get my air pump and fill up the tire . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I unscrewed the cover of the nozzle and then attached the bicycle pump to it . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I then filled the bicycle tire with air . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
After that , I released the bicycle pump and screwed the cover back on . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Then I rode my bicycle a little bit to see if the tire would remain inflated . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
After a couple of loops around the street , I noticed the tire was beginning to flatten again , so I decided to replace the bicycle 's inner tube . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I went to get my spare inner tube as well as a screwdriver and wrench . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I unbolted the wheel from the bicycle with the wrench . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I used the screw driver to take the tire and old inner tube out . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I brought out the new inner tube and placed it inside the tire , then put both back on the wheel and put the wheel on the bike . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I took out my air pump and filled the tire with air until it was firm . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
When I rode around this time the tire remained firm , so I put my things away and rode to the supermarket . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
My husband was riding down a steep hill a few miles from home when he got a blow out . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
He called me to come and get him . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Luckily he was n't hurt . 	0 1 0 0 0 0
He had the bicycle repair kit on him . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
We took the tire off with some tools . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
We took the inner tube out . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0
He checked the inner tube for holes by putting air in it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
He found the hole and marked it . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
That is the place where he put the patch and glued it . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
My husband put the tube back in the bicycle . 	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The frame was a little bent but the bike was okay . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I followed him for a little while . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
He was almost to the park so I met him there . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
After a while we put the bike in the back of the truck and drove home . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I always wear my hair very long , but it needed trimmed because I had some split ends . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I went to my favorite hairdresser , Michael . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
He works in a very nice salon . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We 're friends , so he gave me a hug when he saw me come in . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I was seated in the chair and had an apron tied around my neck to keep the hair off . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
First Michael shampooed my hair , and blew it dry . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Then , he brushed and combed it out thoroughly . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was relaxing and enjoyable to have Michael 's skilled hands working with my hair . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
He is the only hairdresser I 'll go to . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
before long , it was time for the actual cutting of my hair . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
he knew I wanted it left long , so he trimmed off the damaged ends and did the ends of my hair in a pleasing half-moon shape . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

I live near Blacksburg , Virginia and often stay with friends who live near Virginia Tech . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
A bus route stops at their apartment complex and we often ride it downtown to eat brunch after a late night . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Nothing unusual ever happens . 	1 0 0 0 0
We get ready and go to the bus stop . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
There 's a bench and it 's covered but there 's no doors . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

It 's never crowded so we can always find a seat . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
The varying bus drivers are nice and we hop on , pay , and take our seats . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
The ride downtown takes about 10 minutes because of other stops . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
No other passengers ever talk to each other and honestly groups of friends from different races stick together . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Being near a college such as Virginia Tech makes for a very diverse area where different cultures intermingle but the bus seems to have the most obviously segregated groups . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We get to our stop and enjoy brunch . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I like riding the bus because of the convenience factor , no parking , and it feels like we are doing something to help the environment . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

So in early Novermber , I started planning for a vacation and decided to go to New York . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0

I was at the window seat , so I could see the outside pretty well . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Before take off , flight attendants asked us to put on seat belts . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
It took almost 2 hours for us to reach New York . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Overall it was a nice flight and we reached there on time . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0

We were almost out of food so it was a long list . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I drove to the grocery store . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

My friend and I , Joey , decided that we would help to plant a few trees in order to contribute to the efforts . 	1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We received a few tree saplings in the mail from a catalog . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Joey and I decided that we would plant them in our backyard to provide shade . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
While the trees might be small now , hopefully they would grow into big trees for maybe our kids . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
We got all down and dirty in the grass , starting to rake up a circle of grass in order to turn over some topsoil . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We had a trowel , and yes we called it a trowel , and we dug into the dirt to start planting the tree . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We made a six inch deep hole in the soil , and then put the tree in . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
We finished by packing the soil down around the roots of the small tree , and then we watered it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I bake a cake , it is usually for a birthday . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I am baking a cake , I find a good recipe online with good reviews and make sure that I have all of the ingredients needed . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I take all of the ingredients out and then I preheat the oven . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I find the appropriate pans needed and make sure they are clean . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Then I grease and flour the pans and add parchment paper to the bottom . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Next , I will measure and combine all of the dry ingredients , sifting if necessary . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Then I combine the wet ingredients after measuring them and wisk together . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Lastly , I combine the wet and dry gently and stir as little as possible before pouring into the pans and placing into the oven , taking note of the time I need to take them back out . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once baked , I will cool the cakes and frost , either with canned frosting or homemade frosting . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
At the very end I will decorate the cake since it is probably for a birthday . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I love baking cakes . 	1 0 0 1 0
That is why yesterday , I took it upon myself to bake the most delicious chocolate cherry cake the world has ever seen or tasted . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Then , I drove my car home and spread out all the ingredients on the kitchen table . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I pulled out my baking book and found the recipe to the cake I wanted to cook . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I mixed the dry ingredients in one bowl and set them aside . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Then , I took all the eggs and liquid ingredients and blended them in another bowl . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I took both bowls and blended the ingredients . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I preheated the oven to 350 degrees , and put the mixture in a glass pan with a buttered bottom . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I baked it . 	0 1 0 1 0
I was riding my bike the other day when I noticed I was moving slowly , even though I was pedaling hard with a lot of effort . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I stopped and looked at my front wheel and noticed that it was squished down against the pavement and was soft when I pressed it , instead of being firm and tough . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
It did n't have enough air in it to fill it up , like an old balloon . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I took the bicycle home to my garage . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
Inside my garage was my bicycle tire pump . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
The pump would put air back into the tire . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
On my front tire , there was a tiny tube or straw that would let the air in when I used the pump . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The pump also had a long tube with a tiny metal fastener on the end . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I stuck the metal part into the tube so that it can blow air into my bicycle tire . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
The large metal cylinder part of the pump had a handle sticking out the top , which could be pulled out like a pogo stick , and two little metal feet on the bottom . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I stood on the metal feet to keep the pump in place . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then I carefully pulled the handle out and pushed it back in . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
A dial on the pump showed me how much pressure I was putting into the pump by pushing on the handle , which then pushed the air in the tire . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I heard it make a hissing noise . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I kept pulling the handle out and pushing it back in , and noticed that the tire was getting bigger and bigger . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Finally , after a few minutes , I pushed on the tire again . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
It was firm and ready to ride . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I disconnected the pump and put it away . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Then I went out to have fun on my bike again , with my tire working perfectly . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
Repairing a bicycle is vital and I learned how easy and important it is through the many years I have rode bicycles . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
First of all do not think you ca n't do it I will show and you will be glad you learned the first time a tipe deflates way out on a country or something . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
First use tire removing tools that are flat and will not pop tires or tubes and have a portable wrench . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I use small air pressure bulbs that I find are more convenient to use for tire inflation but you can use a hand pump . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Simply remove the wheel and place the new tube in the tire being careful to look for debris that might still be embedded into the tire still . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Then carefully tuck the tire back into the rim and reinflate . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Its a real good thing you now how to change your tire because you never know when a tube will pop or puncture and you can be out of luck if you do n't have your spare tube , tools , and pump . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Yesterday , I went to get a hair cut . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I made an appointment with my hairstylist a week prior . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0

Even though , I wanted a new hair style , I was still very nervous . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Cutting hair is a very big change . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Before she cut my hair , she washed my hair . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
After she washed it , she did n't do a big chop . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
She cut little by little so I wo n't be in utter shock . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Every time she cut it , I took a deep breath and accepted it . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After all , hair does grow back eventually . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Eventually she managed to cut it at the specific length I wanted it . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
Afterwards , she layered it and styled it properly . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
At this point , she did n't let me see the final result until she was finished . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
When she was done , she turned me over to the mirror and I was shocked . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
It was beautiful . 	1 0 0 0

Again , the librarian was very helpful . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
We walked over to the counter , and she helped me sign up for a library card . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
All I had to do was tell her a few things like my name and my address , and I had my very own library card . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Once I had that , it was easy to check out the book . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
She scanned my library card , punched some buttons on her computer , and the book was mine to borrow . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I 'll be sure to bring it back in a few days so I do n't have to pay any late fees . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

I sat for a moment , relaxing , allowing the warm water to sooth my skin . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
After a few moments , I grabbed a bar of soap and lathered my body . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I washed myself carefully because I did not want to spill water onto the floor . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I washed my hair and dunked my head under water to clear the shampoo and conditioner . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After awhile the water began to cool . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

I grabbed a shovel and started to dig , one small hole the size of the pot the sapling was in . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I carefully took the sapling out of the pot and placed it into the freshly dug hole . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Filling in the empty parts of the hole with extra dirt , I marveled at my creation . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
That was the day I planted a tree in my front yard . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
Yesterday was my mom 's birthday . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0
I wanted to do something special for her , so I decided to bake a cake from scratch . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I preheated my oven so it was nice and warm by the time i was done preparing the cake batter . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Then , I gathered all the necessary ingredients for baking a cake . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
There are a lot of ingredients so I wo n't get into much detail about what went into it . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After gathering all the cake ingredients , now it was time to mix them together . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I got the largest bowl in my house and put all of the dry ingredients in it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then , in a separate bowl , I mixed together all of the wet ingredients . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then i combined the wet and dry ingredients into the large bowl , and began to beat them until it was well blended . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I poured the cake batter into a cake pan and put the cake in the oven for 30 minutes . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When it was done , I took it out the oven and let it cool off . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
We had the cake after dinner and it was a huge success ! 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Today , I had to ride the bus home from the market . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I walked over to the bus stop to wait for the next bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It was supposed to arrive in 10 minutes . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When the bus pulled up to the bus stop where I was waiting , I stood up and walked over to curb . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The bus driver opened the bus doors and I stepped up into the bus . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I had to hand my money to the bus driver so that I could ride . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once the driver took my money , I walked down the aisle to find a seat . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
There were many seats available so I picked one beside an older lady that looked like my grandmother . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
She was very nice and talked to me while we rode down the street . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Once the bus stopped down the street from my house , I got off and walked down the sidewalk to my house . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I was very glad to be home . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Yesterday , I found that my bicycle tire was flat and would have to be repaired . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
First , I went to the store in town to purchase a machine that would inflate my bike tire . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
Next , I went to my garage , which is where I keep my bike . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
I found the nozzle in the bike tire where the air is supposed to be pumped into . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I plugged the machine into the wall socket and then attached the nozzle from the machine onto the nozzle on the bike . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I hit the switch , which caused the machine to beep as it added air into the tire . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I watched the gauge on the machine to make sure there was n't too much pressure ; I did n't want my tire to pop like a balloon . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Finally , when I saw that there was enough air in the tire , I turned off the machine and removed it before closing the bike 's tire nozzle tight . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
Now my tire is good as new and I can ride around wherever I 'd like to go . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I 'm glad I got this important job done . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I was looking in the mirror this morning and noticed my hair had gotten out of control . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
So I decided to get a hair cut . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I was new to the area , so first I wanted to research all the available barber shops nearby . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
I found three different places , and all with great reviews . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
So I decided to go the closest one to my house . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
When I got there , I had to wait for the 4 people currently waiting before I arrived . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I started looking at the posters on the wall and came up with some new ideas on what hair cut style I think would look best on me . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided on a buzz cut . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0
When it was my turn I told the barber I wanted a buzz cut . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
He trimmed my hair low , then got a fine-edge razor to get my hairline . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I walked out the barber shop feeling like a new man . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I recently was able to enjoy the privilege of riding a train . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My friend and I had quite a distance to travel . 	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
After some discuss with several option we decided to take a train to our destination . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
We found out where the train station was located and found the window to buy a ticket to our destination . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
We had our choice of coaches but we chose the cheapest one which meant hard seats that do not recline , no air or food offered in our car section . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
I had no idea that it would take 14 hours to travel to our destination . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
It really felt like a lifetime , especially when you can not get comfortable and find a position to relax . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
We tried several ways of resting but after a few minutes we would get up and reposition ourselves . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The ride was nice overall though because the conductor would stop every four hours or so to allow for bathroom breaks and food purchases at the stops . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
We took the night train so the majority of the time we would not able to enjoy the view out of the window but when daylight broke and we were able to see outside it made the trip go by quicker . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
So , overall I have to say that it was a very good experience and cheap too . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
After a long day , I decided to take a bath . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I changed out of my clothes into a plush bathrobe . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I placed a plug in the tub drain so the tub could fill up . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I turned on the water and adjusted it so it was just the right temperature - hot , but not too hot . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I sprinkled in some lavender scented bath salts to make it extra relaxing . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It took about five minutes for the whole tub to fill up . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I did n't fill it all the way to the top . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I had to leave some room since I 'd be getting in . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
When it was ready , I dipped my toe in first , testing out the water . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I hung my robe on the back of the door , and got into the tub . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I eased in slowly since the water was hot . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I got nestled in to the water and washed myself with a washcloth and soap . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then I leaned my head against the rim of the bathtub . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I breathed in the aroma of lavender , closed my eyes , and felt my body and mind completely relax . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
I was sitting on my couch when I decided that I had n't taken a bath in a while so I stood up and walked to the bathroom where I turned on the faucet in the sink and began filling the bath with hot water . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
While the tub was filling with hot water I put some bubble bath into the stream of hot water coming out of the faucet so that the tubbed filled with not only hot water , but bubbles . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once the tub was almost to the top I turned off the water so that none of the water would overflow onto the bathroom floor . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I got undressed and entered the tub , making sure that it 's not very hot . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I relax in the tub until I am happy with my bath and then I get out and dry off with a towel and then get dressed and laid down in my bed and took a nap , feeling very relaxed , content , and happy . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The first time I ever flew in an airplane was last summer . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
My mother and I bought tickets and had a direct flight from Illinois to Virginia to see my sister . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I thought it was cool to see what this was like since I always wanted to walk through an airport . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
So in the 21 years I have been alive , I have only flown in an airplane twice . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
We walked into the airport and went through security and waiting by the section where we would board the plane . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then we boarded when the flight attendants said the plane was ready . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
We put our luggage under our seats and fastened our seat belts . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
The flight attendants spoke to everyone on the plane and told us the safety procedures and rules for being on the plane . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We were then towed out to the runway and the plane took off . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I thought it would be a smooth ride , but boy was I wrong ! 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
The plane was so bumpy taking off and the plane was loud . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Then we landed 4 hours later and undid the seat belts and grabbed out stuff and we walked off the plane and out of the airport . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I enjoyed the ride and it was so cool flying thought the clouds and being up so high . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The other night I went grocery shopping and first I drove my car to the store and parked in the parking lot . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Then I walked into the store and got a shopping cart . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I took the shopping cart and began walking down the isles while I looked at my shopping list . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
I usually write a shopping list when I go to the store to make sure that I do n't forget anything . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I grabbed items from many different isles , like grabbing milk from the fridge at the back of the store and some cheese in the isle next to that . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Once I got everything on my list I took the shopping cart and wheeled it over to the line for the checkout counter and my items are scanned and go down the belt to be bagged . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Finally a bagger bags my groceries and I put them in my cart and out the door of the grocery store and put the grocery bags in my car and put the cart away in the designated shopping cart drop off point . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Every Sunday I check our pantry , fridge and freezer to see what I need to buy from the grocery store . 	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I also have to check the pet supplies as I have dogs and cats that eat a lot ! 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I carry a piece of paper with me and write down what I need to get . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I also have an idea of what meals I intend to cook during the week and what ingredients I will need to make those meals , so I add them to the list . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I know which store or stores I am going to visit and I know the layout of the store so I try and make my list in the same order that the items will be found once I get there . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I pick up a cart on the way into the store and head for the first aisle that I need to visit . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Most supermarkets have their frozen foods at one end so I start at the other end as it is best to buy frozen items last so they do n't start to melt while I 'm walking round the store . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I work my way through my shopping list , selecting items off the shelf and placing them into my cart , trying not to squash lighter things under heavy things and also making sure I buy items that have a use by date that is later than the day I intend to use them . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I am also keeping an approximate idea of how much everything costs so I have some idea of my total bill . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
When I am done with everything I wait at a checkout . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
There is nearly always someone in front of me but the checkout people work fast and I never wait for long . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I place all my items on the conveyor belt and the person on the checkout counter scans them for prices . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
The prices all add up on a screen in front of me so I can see how much I am spending . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
While the checkout person scans my items another shop assistant packs all my items carefully into bags and places them back in my cart . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
When I am finished I am always asked if I need any help taking my bags to the car but I always refuse as I think other people in the store need help more than I do . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I load the car and drive home and then have to put everything into the pantry , freezer or refrigerator . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
That is my least favorite part of grocery shopping ! 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I walked onto the plane and was greeted by the stewardess who had a very kind smile . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I walked slowly behind the other passengers as people were shoving their luggage into the overhead compartments . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I found my seat just ahead of the right wing . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I buckled into my seat next to the window , and prepared myself for takeoff . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
The stewardess explained all the pre-flight information about safety . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
The plane started to taxi to the runway . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
My stomach started to get a little twisted . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The engines started to roar and the passengers were pushed back into their seats . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
In a few seconds the plane started climbing and we were off . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I watched the the trees and the buildings get smaller and smaller . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
After a few minutes we started to level off and everything on the ground looked miniature . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
We were above the clouds for most of the flight , but I still love looking out the window . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
As we began our descent , we went through rain clouds and it was a bit bumpy , but we landed safely and exited the plane the same way we began , slow and without efficiency . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Today I am taking an airplane to go visit my grandmother . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I bought the ticket a few weeks ago and last night I packed my suitcases with clothes and the other items I would need for my trip . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I woke up early today and got my ID and my suitcase and headed for the airport . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After I parked my car , I went to the check in counter and showed the worker my ID . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
She printed out a ticket for me , checked in my suitcase and told me what gate to head to in order to catch my flight . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
As I got close to the gate I went through security where they scanned my purse and carry-on bag then had me remove my shoes and walk through the metal detectors . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I put my shoes back on and got my bags and then sat down and waited for my flight to start boarding . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
When they made an announcement that my plane was boarding , I got in line and waited my turn . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Once I got on the plane I looked at my ticket to find my seat number , found my seat and sat down and buckled my seat belt . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0

Last night , I had to bake a cake for my son 's birthday party . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
I decided to go online to find a recipe to follow that a lot of people seemed to like . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I found a great chocolate cake recipe and printed it out . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
Once it was done being printed , I brought it into the kitchen and started gathering supplies . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Among the supplies were eggs , flour , sugar , and more . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
First thing 's first : I had to set the oven for 350 degrees . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The best way to follow a baking recipe is by adding the dry ingredients like flour and baking powder together first . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
Once those are mixed together , the wet ingredients are mixed together and added to the dry ingredients . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I followed the measurements in the recipe and mixed together the cake batter . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I grabbed a rectangle cake pan , oiled it and shook some flour around the edges . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I poured the cake into the pan and put it into the oven for about 18 minutes . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
When I thought it was done , I checked the cake with a toothpick by putting it in the middle . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The toothpick came out clean , without any batter on it , so I knew the cake was done . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I let it cool for a few hours , added icing , and enjoyed it at the birthday party . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I was traveling on vacation a few months ago , and decided to take a train to my destination instead of flying . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I have always wanted to travel by train , and this was a good opportunity . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went online to look at the train schedules . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
There were quite a lot of them , so it took me a while to narrow down my choices based on when I wanted to leave and then arrive at my vacation destination . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
I finally was able to choose a time and date , and I purchased my tickets with my credit card . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
The day finally arrived to take my vacation . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I went to the train station and checked in with the railway . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
They gave me a paper ticket , which I then brought to the rail line . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
When we boarded the train , we gave the ticket to a ticket taker , and he escorted me to my booth . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
It was fun and exciting . 	1 0 1 0 0 0
Finally after all the passengers were on board , we were off . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
The train seemed a bit jerky in the motion , but eventually it smoothed out . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was so much fun , seeing all of the towns and cities we passed through . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
Some we stopped at and some we just passed through . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
People would get on and off when we stopped . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I was able to purchase some food in a car that sold sandwiches . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I slept some in my car , which was a bit uncomfortable , but I did n't mind . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Before I knew it , we had arrived at my vacation destination . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
I was really glad that I had taken a train , and was able to see a lot of our beautiful country . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I was bored one weekend and decided I would like to read a new book . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I checked in my wallet to make sure I had my library card . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
Seeing that I did in fact have the card , I got in my car and drove to the nearest branch of the public library , about four miles from my home . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
When I went in , I first checked out the new arrivals , both fiction and non-fiction . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then I looked at biographies , then at the books on the stacks for favorite authors . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I finally decided on a few selections , two from the new fiction section and one from the new non-fiction section , as well as a book on poetry . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I went to the check-out desk and presented the books along with my card to the librarian . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
She checked the books out to me along with a receipt which told me when the books were due back . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I decided to bake a cake for my daughter 's birthday . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
I had gone to the grocery store to buy one , but nothing looked very good and they were really expensive for what I was getting . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I figured that I could make a better cake myself . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I figured that I have seen cooking shows and said , '' `` How hard could it be ? '' '' 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I bought a Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix and I thought it looked pretty good . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I went to the frosting and found some Oreo frosting mix and thought it would be perfect because my daughter loves Oreo cookies . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
Then , I grabbed a box of Oreo cookies , some eggs , milk , and some oil . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I did not know if I had all of that at home , but I figured they would not go to waste . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I came home and mixed everything and put it in the oven . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I tested the cake before taking it out of the oven with a toothpick . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Coming out clean , I decided the cake was done . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I had pour the cake mix into two baking pans because my plan was to make a two layered cake . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I saw on a cooking show that you are supposed to cut the top of one of the cakes so that the top was flat . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I managed to do that pretty well and I ate the cake with some milk . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It was pretty tasty . 	1 0 0 0 0
So , next , I got the frosting and put it on the first layer , and then on the second . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I thought it looked pretty good . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I carefully chopped some oreos up and sprinkled them on the top of the cake . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
To further top it off , I cut a few cookies in half and stuck them pointing up in a circle around the outside of the cake . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It looked really good . 	1 0 0 0 0
My wife was really surprised that I had made it myself . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
My daughter was really happy and everyone liked the cake . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
My yard was very bare and plain-looking so I decided to add some trees to the landscape . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
First , I went to the local nursery and asked them for advice on what kinds of trees would do well in my area , level of sunlight , amount of precipitation , etc . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
They gave me some ideas and I picked out a Bradford pear tree sapling . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I took it home and left it in shade while I prepared to plant it . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
First I got out a shovel and dug a deep enough hole to cover the whole root ball of the tree . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Then I placed some fertilizer in the bottom of the hole . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Next I unwrapped the root ball from the burlap sack which contained it and placed it in the hole that I had dug . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Once it was in , I shoveled the dirt back into the opening and tamped it firmly around the base of the tree . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After that I placed a soaker hose near it to give it plenty of water . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
While preparing a dinner of Spaghetti and Meatballs tonight , I realized I needed to go grocery shopping to restock my refrigerator . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
It was still early and the store wasn ' t close so I made a trip to the store . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I grabbed a shopping cart because I ' m out of eggs , bread , orange juice , milk etc . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
I don ' t like can foods but I like to keep some stocked in my cabinet just in case . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I needed corn , beets , soup etc. . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
I had to eat bread ends because I was out of whole wheat bread . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
The store wasn ' t so crowded considering it would be closing in an hour or so . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I got in the shortest line and of course the register broke down . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I waited and waited . 	1 0 0 0 0
I could have gotten out of line but I didn ' t . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
When I finally got to the register , it was time for my checker to leave . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I had to wait until an assistant manager signed in the register to ring up my purchases . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
The register was out of tape so I was delayed again . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I wished I ' d waited until tomorrow . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
There were no baggers to bag my groceries so I did it myself . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
My total came to $ 51.34 and I only had $ 20.00 cash on me . 	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
That ' s all I thought I was going to spend . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I gave the clerk a credit card which didn ' t go through and the people behind me started blowing and hissing under their breath . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I offered another card . 	1 0 0 1 0

It was no different this past weekend when i got the hankering for a chocolate cake . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I first went out a bought the ingredients . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
They were as follows , 3/4 cups butter , 3 eggs , 2 cups sugar , 2 cups flour , 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder , 1 teaspoon baking soda , 3/4 teaspoon baking powder , 2 teaspoon vanilla , and 1 1/2 cup milk . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
I pre-heated my oven to 350 degrees . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I then greased and floured three 6 " " X 1 1/2 " " round cake pans . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
I mixed together the flour , cocoa powder , baking powder and baking soda . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
In a different large bowl , I beat butter , eggs and vanilla like it stole something . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Gradually I added the sugary goodness of sugar to the mix . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Beating this on medium to the sound of fallout boy , I did this until it was well mixed . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I then alternately combined in the flour mixture and milk to batter while beating . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Continuing to beat until batter was smooth , I then poured equal amounts of batter into the greased and floured round cake pans . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I tossed this delicious mixture into the oven to bake for 35 minutes . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Finally I was able to remove the cakes , which I then placed on a wire cooling rack . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
Another 40 minutes passed , after which I proceeded to destroy all the cakes , eating every last bite until I could n't eat any more ! '' 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

I go through my kitchen and look for items I don ' t have or are very low on : food , sponges , spices , napkins , etc. . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I also quickly check my bathroom to see if I need anything in there : toilet paper , soap , deodorant , etc. . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I do this because I can buy both sets of items at the grocery store in the same trip . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I make a list of these things on a piece of paper or type them in my phone , so I can easily recall any of the items I need without forgetting anything . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I drive to the store after I prepare my bags in the trunk . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0

Now I ' m ready to start my grocery shopping : I mechanically go down every aisle and pick up any items I need from those aisles , all the while keeping an eye on my list to make sure I don ' t forget anything . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

After making the purchase , we went looking for a place to plant our tree . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
We agreed on her backyard , since my house does not have much of a yard . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When we got to her house , we found a perfect place in the corner of her backyard . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
We grabbed our shovels and began to roughen the sides and bottom of where we were planting a tree , so that the root tips can penetrate the soil . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then we created a water basin with mulch and filled the basin with water . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

We ca n't wait to see how our tree will grow over the years . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I made sure that the doors to the airplane were all closed and all the passengers were seated and buckled in . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
After I went on the speaker and told everybody we were ready to depart , I carefully increased the speed of the plane as it bolted down the runway . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
As the plane reached maximum speed on the driveway , i slowly pulled on the lever to lift the plane off the ground slowly . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
The plane eventually came completely off the runway and was in flight . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I pulled the lever to lift the wheels into the plane . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I manuveured the plane 's direction with the pilot wheel to aim it at the direction I wanted to go . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
As soon as the plane was at a maximum flying height I put the autopilot on and let the plane 's computer fly it automatically . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
I sat back and kept watched over the data on the plane 's dashboard the rest of the flight until we got to where we were going . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
After a long day at work , the thing I want and love the most is a hot bath . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I like to run the water very hot ! 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I like bubbles added , the kind that smell like mangoes . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I pour a glass of wine while the water runs , and bring it with me into the bathroom . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once the tub is full , I finally allow myself to get in . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Ah , perfect ! 	1 0 0 0
I lay back and let the hours of work just slip away . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
Sometimes I 'll bring a book in with me and sink into a good story as the hot water dulls away any aches and pains . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I sip on my wine and enjoy the soft popping bubbles around me . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I have finally had enough , I 'll slowly drain the tub , and then get up and dry off with a huge fluffy towel . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After taking a bath I always feel refreshed and relaxed ! 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I stood at the bus stop and consulted the bus timetable . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
My bus should be there any minute . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
There were several people waiting with me . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
We were standing under the shelter , because it had started raining . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Then I saw the bus arriving . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0
It pulled up to the bus stop and we all stood in line to get on . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I said hello to the driver and paid my fare . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then I found an empty seat at the back of the bus . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I sat down and looked out the window at the city while we drove . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
There were many stops and people getting off and on . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
The bus grew so crowded that someone came and sat next to me . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I scooted over to make room and kept looking out the window . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Finally it was my stop . 	0 1 0 1 1 0
I said excuse me to the person sitting next to me , and he moved over to let me go by . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I stood up and walked off the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I had arrived at my location . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Every day I wash myself in one form or another . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
It is imperative to stay clean and hygienic . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Last night I decided to switch up my normal routine of taking a shower , and decided to take a nice bubble bath ! 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
To prepare for the luscious endeavor , I stopped at LUSH on my way home from work . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
LUSH has a variety of ` bath bombs ' that can be used to enhance a bath . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I found a dragonfruit-passionberry bomb , and purchased it . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Although I am a straight man , I love to pamper myself . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Getting home , the first thing I did was turn the hot water on in the bath to fill it up . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
The warm water filled the tub and tendrils of mist rose from the steamy water . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
The warmth was positively inviting ! 	0 1 0 0 0 0
I dropped the bath bomb in and stepped into the tub myself . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Lowering myself slowly into the water 's embrace , I relaxed fully . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
After spending 20 minutes and becoming a pruny mass , my bath was complete and my whole persona was now clean . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
This morning I arrived at the train station to take a train to my sisters house in Texas . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
I had pre-purchased my ticket for the Amtrak train leaving a 6 am . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
So I arrived around 30 minute before hand to check in and get to the platform in time to get my train . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
This was the first time have taken a long distance train and figured it would be similar to the local city trains I take to work each day . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
As the train boards I found my correct car and seat . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I entered the car and saw how much nicer these trains are compared to the local one . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The seats were similar to seats on a tour coach , and was actually quite nice inside . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I brought a book along to read and help pass the time . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I settled in my seat and a nice elderly woman sat down next to me , We exchanged pleasantries and she puled out a blanket she was crocheting for her grandson . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I was fascinated with her work and she started to teach me as the train pulled away from the platform . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
She spent most of the trip working on the blanket as I watched . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Eight hours later , it seemed like much less , the train pulled into the station and it was time for me to get off . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I said good bye to the woman and thanked her for teaching me what she had . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
She went back to her work as I got off the train . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My sister was waiting on the platform for me and we got into her car and headed to the nearest craft store to purchase crocheting supplies . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
This past weekend I went to get a hair cut . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
My hair has grown out quite a bit and I hate it when it takes too long to dry . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
That 's usually my indication to get a hair cut . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I went down to the barber shop near my apartment early in the morning so that I could avoid the lines . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
This particular time I was the first to arrive . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The barber knows me already so I just hop into the chair and tell him the usual . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
The usual for me is to just cut my hair short . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
This involves using the trimmer on the back and sides , and then a scissor cut on the top . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
The top I keep longer otherwise it sticks up and is uncontrollable . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The process takes about 20 minutes but there 's a TV there so I can watch some of the news while he cuts my hair . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
After the haircut , I pay him and leave him a pretty good tip since we 've known each other for so long . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I get my hair cut at an inexpensive hair salon where people can not make appointments or choose their stylist . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
So when I get to the shop , the first thing I do is go up to the desk and give my name . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then , I sit and wait with everyone else until my turn comes . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
Usually I read magazines and eavesdrop on conversations to pass the time . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Eventually , a stylist comes and gets me . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
He or she leads me to a chair in a line of chairs in front of a huge mirror . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
She -LRB- it is almost always a woman -RRB- puts a plasticized drape around me to keep the hair from going down my blouse . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
During this period , we also greet one another and tell each other our names . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once she gets me draped she asks me what kind of cut I want , and I usually ask that she just trim what I already have . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I have short fine hair I wear in a wash and wear style , and I never want it washed before it is cut . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
She begins cutting my hair , usually asking styling questions like whether I want my ears to show and whether I want the bangs feathered . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
As she cuts , we chat about something unimportant , like a dog that runs by the window or a TV show . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Many times I have talked to stylists about their children , or mine . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
At the same time , the stylist will exchange a few remarks with other stylists , and I will spy on other peoples ' haircuts . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
When she finishes , the stylist will give me a hand mirror so I can inspect the back of my head . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
She brushes me off and removes my drape , and I slip her a folded bill . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Chances are I will never see her again . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Where I live , I always need to take a public bus to the train station to get to my destinations . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
The bus is not usually on schedule so sometimes this can be frustrating especially on a cold winter day as you are waiting for a bus . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Since the discovery of a bustimes app on my iphone , i am able to know exactlly when my bus arrives using their GPS technology . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
It is accurate most of the times . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I get ready to leave my house , look at my bustimes app to see when the bus is arriving , and then leave my house to catch the bus without wasting my time waiting for the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I pay the fare getting on the bus , greet the driver with a smile , and find a seat to sit down . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
It is a short ride to my train station where i can get on the train to my final destination . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
My cousin wanted me to visit him in Florida over the summer and I needed to make a plan and book a flight to get there . 	1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
After searching on the internet for a great price , I found one and booked it . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
The day of the flight I was a bit nervous as it had been a long time since I had flown on an airplane . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I boarded along with the other passengers and realized that I had a great window seat in a good location so I was n't crowded in . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
After a very smooth take off , the flight attendants brought me something to drink and a snack . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It was a very smooth flight and about 6 hours later , I ended up at my destination . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
It all went very nicely and I was happy to be back on the ground . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After we parked at our terminal , we all orderly departed the airplane . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After walking down the tunnel leading into the airport , I saw my family members waiting for me . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
It was a very pleasurable experience . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
First we began by going to the orchard and picking the best tree we could find , this however did not satisfy the little ones so we had to go with the tree that they picked out . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
We drove back home with the tree on top of the car to begin the planting . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Starting off I dug a medium sized hole where we could plant the tree and it could grow as much as it wanted . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
We fertilized the ground where the tree would be planted and began the transfer of the tree . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
This tree was then checked daily on its progress and to be watered . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
The tree 's health was a priority of our family and we kept it in spectacular condition . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
This tree now stands tall over our house to protect it from the sun and allow us the shade we need when we would like to play outside . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

The night before I used the internet to find out what time the bus would be arriving at the stop nearest my house , and made plans to leave the house early so I could be at the bus stop on time . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I made sure to leave a bit earlier than I thought would be necessary , just in case something came up that might make me late . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
When I arrived at the bus stop , I sat down on the bench and waited for the bus to arrive . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was right on time ! 	1 0 0 0 1 0
The doors to the bus opened , and I asked the lady behind the wheel how much an all day pass was . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
She told me it would be $ 2.00 , so I took some money out of my wallet and placed it into the collection tray . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I then walked to the back of the bus and picked a seat that looked comfortable . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
After everyone else had sat down , the bus began to move . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
When I saw that I was getting close to work , I grabbed the yellow cord above my head and pulled , which caused a light to flash and a bell to ring , signalling the bus driver that I wanted to get off at the next stop . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The bus then pulled over at the next stop , and I thanked the driver and got off . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I visited the library and asked the main librarian where I could find the fiction books . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I followed her instructions and then looked around the shelves for the mystery genre books . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I browsed through the shelves of mystery books for a few minutes and picked out a few books that looked interesting . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Then , I sat down in a comfy chair near the shelves and read the beginnings to the books I had chosen to see if I would really like them . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I narrowed it down to one book that I found interesting and enjoyable to read . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I placed the other books on a shelf to be returned to their proper place by the librarian . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I took the book and went to the front of the library and pulled out my library card . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
I handed my library card and the book to the librarian and she scanned them both using her card scanner . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
She informed me of the due date of the book and I thanked her for her help . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
I left the library to go home . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I wanted to get a book on gardening , so I went to the library . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I was n't sure where the gardening books were , so I went to the electronic card catalog and looked gardening up . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I found the Dewey Decimal number and then went down the rows of shelves until I got to the right number . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
There were so many books ! 	0 0 0 0 1 0
I have a small yard , so I thought a book on container gardening would be best . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I chose one with lots of pictures . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I then took the book to the circulation desk and waited in line behind a mother with a child . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The child had about twenty picture books . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
This could be a while . 	0 0 0 0 1 0
Finally , it was my turn . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I gave the librarian my library card and book and she scanned them both in a laser reader . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Then she handed me my book and a receipt . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
Looks like I have three weeks to learn how to garden ! 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Last week my boss told me that I needed to go to a meeting in New York . 	0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I decided the best way to get to New York was to take a train . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went online and bought a train ticket that would get me there well ahead of the meeting start time . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
On the day of the trip I went to the train station and stood in line at the ticket counter . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
When I got to the front of the line I told the agent my name and they pulled up my reservation on their computer and printed out a paper ticket . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I thanked them , took the ticket , and left the counter . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once I left the counter I went to the gate to wait for my train to come . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
When my train arrived , everyone waiting for that train lined up and walked through the gate while the attendant checked our tickets . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once I walked through the gate , I went outside and boarded the train . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Thankfully I was able to sit alone , and I pulled out a magazine to read . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
A little while after the train started moving the conductor walked through the train car to check everyone 's ticket . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I handed my ticket to the conductor and he scanned it and handed it back to me . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Now I could enjoy my train ride and get back to reading my magazine . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
A little while later the conductor announced that the train had arrived in New York . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
The train came to a stop , and I got off of the train along with everyone else . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I was pleased that I had a pleasant train ride , and I walked quickly through the train station to go outside and catch a cab to get to my meeting . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Last week , I went to one of my favorite hairstylists after trying to get an appointment with her for over a month . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
She 's very in demand and it is hard to get an appointment with her . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After finally getting one , I was very happy to be able to see her as my hair had gotten a bit too long for my tastes . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
When I got there , she started with a very gentle shampooing and scalp massage . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
She also gave me a beer to have while this was happening . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Afterwards she did some aromatherapy and walked me back over to her chair where she cut my hair . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
She knows me well as I go to her fairly often when I feel like spending good money on a haircut , so it turned out great ! 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Afterwards , I thanked her and made sure to leave her a nice tip for her good work . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Finally , I left and went home . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Every time I have to go to school or work I have to always ride a public bus . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I have to make sure that I am by the bus stop in order to catch the bus on time . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I get on the bus , I have to pay the bus fare . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I live in a big city , so there 's always a lot of people needing to take the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Therefore ; sometimes I am not lucky to find a seat to sit on . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
In that case , I would have to stand up . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Overall , riding a bus is not enjoyable because it tends to be dirty , people are very loud , and it is very crowded . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Not to mention , it always smells like urine . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My commute is always a long one . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I usually stay on the bus for one hour . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
For that one hour on the bus , I listen to music or play on my cell phone . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
Eventually , I get to my stop . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I get off the bus and reach my destination . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I was excited for the upcoming party . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I knew that I had a big day ahead of me which would be filled with planning and buying groceries . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
i made a list of everything that I would need . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Chips , dip , pretzels , soda , cheese , crackers , frozen pizza , and frozen mozzarella sticks were just some of the things I needed to get . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I drove to the supermarket and decided to get a big shopping cart to put everything in . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
I checked my list and then pushed my shopping cart from aisle to aisle . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
I saw that the chips were on sale so I was able to get an extra bag . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After all of the snacks I went to the frozen aisle in order to get the pizza and mozzarella sticks . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
It was time for checkout so i waited on line until it was my turn . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
The cashier scanned my items and I swiped my credit card to pay for them . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
She bagged everything up and I was ready to go on my way home . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
Yesterday , I went to the grocery store to buy food . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I went to my locally-owned supermarket , Bet-R , because I like to support small businesses . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I go in the early afternoons when I can to avoid the rush of people going after school or work -- that way I do n't have to wait in long lines at checkout . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I brought my shopping list with me : eggs , milk , bread , pasta , and other staples . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I picked up a handbasket as my list was not large and began to peruse the aisles . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I picked up everything on my list , except one thing . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
They were out of my favorite variety of pasta sauce , so I bought a new kind to try instead . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I did not intend to pick up anything that was not on my list , but I noticed the pints of strawberries were very inexpensive and decided to buy some as well . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I was finished in about 20 minutes and got in line for checkout . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I paid for my groceries and packed them in the reusable bag I had brought along with me . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

I was so excited to go on my first trip to Florida by airplane . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I made sure to buy a window seat so I could see the beautiful view from high up in the sky . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I listened carefully to the flight attendant as she gave her speech about safety precautions . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
After she finished the pilot got on the loud speaker and informed us that we will be taking off shortly . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
He told us what time we will be landing in Florida and even the temperature it will be when we landed . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
He then told us to buckle our seat belt and turn off any electronic devices we may have with us . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
A couple minutes later the engine came to life and the plane started moving towards the runway . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When it reach the runway it started to speed up very fast and after a minute I felt the plane lift off of the ground . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I looked out the window and saw us leaving the ground . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0

I was feeling like relaxing after a long day , so I had the idea to take a bath . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I went to the bathroom . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
I removed my clothes . 	1 0 1 1 0
Then I started the water and adjusted the temperature with the faucet . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I grabbed some bath oils and put them in the water . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once the water was high enough , I stepped into the tub . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
It was very warm . 	1 0 0 0 0
I slid my body underneath the water . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Steam drifted up from the surface of the water . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I felt my muscles loosening up and relaxing . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
The bath oils gave off a minty aroma . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After some time luxuriating in the water , I took my washcloth and put some soap on it . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I began to soap up my skin . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I started with my face , then worked my way down to my feet . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0

The water began to feel lukewarm , so I decided to end my bath . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I took out the stopper and stepped out of the tub . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Riding in a public bus is an inexpensive way to get around your city . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I did this often last year . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
First , I look up where I need to go on google maps and map it from my address to my destination address using public transit as my option . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I then factor the departure and arrival times into my schedule , as well as make sure I have the proper amount of cash and\/or change for the fare . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I would then walk to the bus stop at least 5 minuted ahead of time , as they can sometimes come early . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
When the bus appears I wait for him to stop and then I greet the driver , deposit the fare -LRB- exact change -RRB- and take a seat where available . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
While on the bus I look out the window to see where I am , and make sure that I press the button or pull the cord when my stop is near . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I wanted something interesting to read as I have several days with no plans starting this weekend . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I enjoy various types of books but wanted something really different so I decided to go with a good science fiction and something that was rated well by reviewers . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

I asked the librarian where the sci fi section was and showed me . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Before looking for the one I wanted I browsed the books and saw several that looked interesting . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I opened one in particular and starting going through it . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided to select this book . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I then looked for the book I came to borrow and eventually found it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Remarkably it had the same author as the previous book I had selected . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I must have great taste in books . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I brought both books to the front desk and checked them out . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
I was very pleased with the library and quite happy to have more than one book to look forward to reading . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

I picked up a few books and read the first page or so of each one . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once I found one that looked like it would be a good read , I picked it up and took it over to the front counter . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
There was a short line , so I waited while other people signed up for library cards and checked out books . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Once I arrived at the counter , the librarian took my book and scanned it . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
She told me it would be due two weeks from now , and gave me a receipt . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I thanked her and exited the library . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The other day , I had to catch a train from Los Angles to New York at the last minute . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
My boss wanted me to meet some foreign client in a brand new art gallery they recently bought in Manhattan . 	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
The boss called me at about 5:30 in the morning and told me that he already bought tickets to get from here to New York , but explained to me that he could n't make it as he had another meeting to that same morning . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The tickets were for a train that departed at 7:15 am , so like a good worker bee , I got up , skipped showering , got dressed , and ran out the door with a dirty wrinkled suit I had n't had time to wash . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
The airport was 40 minutes away so I had very little time to spare . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I managed to store my car and walk into the train station half asleep right at 7:10 am when I overheard my train was delayed over the intercom . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When my train was called an hour later , I drowsily made my way on board where I got a window seat next to a larger fellow . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I remember I was half asleep when I mumbled a hello to him . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
He happily greeted me back as I sat down . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Right before the train took off and the trains stewardesses were telling us how to use our seat belts , I barely remember ending up falling asleep on the large man next to me . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Four hours later , I got a nudge from the large man next to me telling me kindly to wake up and that our ride was over . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I distinctly remember waking up with a mouthful of drool soaked on the large man ' s arm I feel asleep on and instantly apologized . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
He laughed and said to me Don ' t worry about it ! 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
You looked so tired ! 	1 0 0 0 0
Would you believe this is n't the first time this has happened to me ? 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We both kind of laughed and went on our ways . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
It ended up being a great ride and sleep , overall . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I went on a bike ride in the afternoon yesterday , the weather had an amazing break of sunlight , and I had to take advantage of it . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Gearing up for the bike ride was n't very time consuming , it only took about 5 minutes to change , grab my helmet , and fill a water bottle from the sink . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I left home , and progressed close to 6 miles before I heard a low hiss escape from somewhere below where my feet were . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
I almost knew immediately that it was going to be a flat tire . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I had my friend pick me up , they helped get me home without further incident . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
After getting my bike up on it 's stand , I began to peel the bad tire off the rim , finding the tube had a small puncture . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I decided to to replace the tube entirely , and fitted the tube and tire back onto the rim , fixing the issue of the flat tire . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My bike tire was flat so I went to the bike shop and bought a replacement . 	1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I first took the old tire off of my bike . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then I set my bike on a rack to that the flat tire would be easy to get to . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Then I put the new tire around the wheel to see if it fits . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
It did . 	1 0 0
Then I put the new tire into the grooves inside the wheel . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I walked with my bike to the gas station just around the corner to fill it up with air . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I put a quarter into the air machine and put my bike next to the air hose and filled the tire up . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I checked the air pressure with a gauge and it was alright . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I felt around the tire to make sure that it was solidly in place and it was . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
When riding bikes , sometimes the tires will go flat . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
This can happen either because you ran over something and there is a hole , or because the tire is leaking air somewhere . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Sometimes you can just get a pump and refill the tire with air , and sometimes you need to replace the entire thing . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
There is this stuff that I have used before that worked for small holes though , it was like this foam stuff that is in a bottle . 	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
You just spray it in and let it sit for a little bit . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
the foam closes the hole up and you can refill the tire and everything works again if the hole was n't a bad one . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
If the tire is too far gone , you wo n't be able to repair it with anything and will end up replacing the whole thing or risk riding on the metal rims which can seriously damage your bike . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Yesterday I used my new library card to borrow a book . 	1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
It was so easy ! 	1 0 0 0 0
I drove down to the library early in the morning , just as soon as the library opened . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
When I entered the library , I said hi to the lady behind the counter , and went over to the science fiction section to look for a book that might catch my fancy . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I soon found a very good looking book about a boy who meets an alien in his backyard . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I really wanted to read the book , but I knew it would take me a few days , so I decided to borrow it for awhile . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I brought the book up to the lady at the counter , and she asked me for my library card . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
I showed it to her , and she entered some information in the computer . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
She told me to bring the book back in one week . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I promised I would , then I thanked her and went home to read the book ! 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I came home after work and desperately needed a bath to unwind from the long day . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
So , I went to the hall closet and I pulled out my towel , various lotions , bath potions and scrubby and took them into the bathroom . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I sat my stuff beside the tub and turned on the water to a nice , warm temperature and put in the drain stopper . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Since I did n't want to get my hair wet , I brushed it and put it up in a bun . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Noticing that the tub was filling nicely , I added in my bath oil and got undressed , folding my clothes and setting them on top of the closed hamper . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The tub was full enough , so I turned off the water and slid in . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I washed my body with my special soaps and my scrubby . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
Rubbing down my legs and arms felt pretty good and made the tub smell even nicer . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I then sat back and cleared my mind , letting my skin soak in the oils . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
After I had relaxed for a bit and the water started to cool , I pulled the drain plug and stood up to grab my towel and started to dry off . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Yesterday , I decided that I wanted to read a book and went to the library with my friend . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
We entered the library and started browsing through all the books . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I remembered a mystery novel that I had read about and wanted to read . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I went to the library 's computer and looked up the title of the mystery book to see if it was available . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Luckily , it was available for me to check . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I wrote down the call number and located the book in the stacks . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I found my friend and told her that I found a book that I wanted to borrow and was ready to check out . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I waited in line at the checkout counter and when I reached the front of the line , I greeted the librarian . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I handed him the book and my library card and he scanned both into the library 's system , successfully borrowing the mystery book . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I started reading it today and it is really good . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I 'm so happy I found it at the library yesterday . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Yesterday , I went grocery shopping . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0
Before I had left , I made a list of most of the things that I needed to buy for the week . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I looked at the sales advertisement that had come in the mail and made a note of a few things that were on sale . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I needed to buy milk , bread , eggs , coffee , and some items to make lunches for me to take to work for the week . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When I got to the store , I first went to the deli and picked out some lunch meat . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I got some turkey , ham , and salami . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I then picked up some cheddar cheese . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Near the deli , I grabbed some bread , which happened to be on sale . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
A few isles over , I found some decent coffee that was not on sale . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
My shopping was almost complete after I picked up a half gallon of milk and a dozen eggs . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I saw that the yogurt was on sale , so I grabbed a few of those in my favorite flavors . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I was trying to find some other things to make my lunch with , so I grabbed some bananas . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I also picked up a bag of chips . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
It looked like I had everything that I needed for making lunches for the week . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I was ready to leave , so I made my way towards the front of the store . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I went into the express line because I had less than twenty items . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was finally done and I ended up finishing my shopping in less than a half hour . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was pleased with my efficiency . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Planting a tree is a very difficult task . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
First , I went to Walmart or another nursery in the area and pick a tree . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
When I get to Walmart , I asked the cashier for which trees are easiest to take care because I can not take care of plants very well . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Then I figured out whether I want a tree for the sun or shade . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I picked a tree , I took it to the cashier and paid for it . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I put the tree in the back of my car and went home . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Next , when I got home , I took the tree outside and figured out where I wouldput it in the yard . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Afterwards , I dug a whole where the tree would go . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
The hole was the size of the pot of the tree . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I pulled the tree out of the pot and put the whole thing in the hole I dug . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
Then , I covered the sides with more dirt and put some fertilizer and water around the tree so it set in the ground . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
One day I decided that my backyard was missing something . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I walked around in my backyard and decided that a tree would go perfectly in the corner . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I drove to my local plant store and walked around looking at all the various trees . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I read the tags and found one that would do perfect in my climate and it looked very cool . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I walked up to the worker and told them I would like to purchase the tree . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
They loaded the tree up and I paid for the tree and drove home . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I brought the tree into the backyard and set it down . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I took out my shovel and dug a large enough hole for the tree . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I placed the tree in the hole and filled it in with dirt . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Then I took my hose and watered the tree in place . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I took a step back and marveled at how wonderful my new tree looked . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Last year I moved into a new house with my husband and my son . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
We decided that we wanted to start a garden . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We planted flowers and vegetables , and we decided we would add a tree next to the garden . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
We knew that the tree would be a nice addition to the garden . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Since I was unfamiliar with planting trees , I decided to look up different types of trees I could plant . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
I wanted to plant a tree that would grow well in our local climate . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I went to the home and garden store to look at different trees . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
A salesperson helped me pick out a tree . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I took it home and planted it according to the instructions . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I made sure the soil was packed firmly at the base of the tree . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Now that a year has passed , the tree has grown quite a bit . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It is a nice plant that we all enjoy . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
With a family of five it seemed like all we ever did was go to the supermarket . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Walmart and I built a strong personal relationship . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Not only did they have household items and clothes that I loved , they had food . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Every week I spend an hour online printing and sorting my coupons . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
It is always to good to grab extra deals even if it is just cents off . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
After compiling my coupons I make my shopping list and break it down to aisles . 	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It 's so amazing that I have been to Walmart so many times that I remember their aisles . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
When I arrive in the food section I start with the middle aisles first and then I work my way around , getting milk last . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Sometimes I have to buy so many things that I leave with two or three carts . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Grocery shopping is beyond a tedious task that I hate to love . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I was a little nervous about my plane trip , but my friend was coming with me , and that made me feel a little better . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
We went to the airport , and gave our bags to an attendant to be checked onto the plane . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We went through the security station to make sure everything was safe , then we were ready to go to our terminal . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
We were there a little early , so we grabbed a bite to eat at the restaurant while we waited . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
When the plane arrived , we gave the attendant our tickets and got on the plane . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once we were all seated , the flight attendant went over some safety rules with us before we took off . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I watched out the window as we got higher and higher . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
It was a little scary , but kind of fun , too . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
The flight attendant came by and gave us all a little snack during the flight . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
By the time we landed , I was n't scared anymore . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

I recently needed to go to a moderately distant city . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Because it is on the other side of a local mountain range , travel in my car would be very hard on it , and I might get lost . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Fortunately there is a passenger train that goes between out two cities . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I had , before this trip , never been on any kind of train bigger than one at the amusement park . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I was very excited for this opportunity . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I arrived at the station I was very pleased to see that the train had large windows . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
While on the trip these proved to be wonderful for all of the gorgeous views provided by nature . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
As my trip was a half day journey . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I stopped in the dining car for lunch , I found it highly enjoyable to eat on the train , and this also helped to distract me from the time . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When I arrived in the other city I met a friend who was eager to learn about my trip . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Borrowing a book from the library is so nice and super simple to do . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I love doing this because if you want to read a book and not buy it , then just go borrow it from the library . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Almost every library will add new books to their collection if you ask . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
You just need a library card and you can get one from any library since they are free if you have a picture ID card of yourself and an address where you reside . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
If you know what type of book you want , you can go to the section of the library that has that category or you can ask a librarian to help you . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
If you ask politely where a certain book is , they are more than happy to help you find the book . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
So once you find the book you are looking for , you take it to the checkout desk and present them with your library card , then they punch the card into their computer system and scan the barcode on the book so they have a record of who has what book . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
They then tell you when the book is due , and for the next designated time frame , you can spend your time enjoying the book you are borrowing from the library . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I go to the library just about every day and find a good book to read and I sit outside and read it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went and got the Divergent book and started reading it today in the library . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I had to ask the librarian where to find it in the library since it was not where I thought it would be , She kindly helped me find it and asked what types of books that I enjoy reading and suggested some for me to check out after I finish this one and then I went on my way to dive into this book and enjoy the story since I saw the movie last week . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Last week , my friend and I rode the public bus into town . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
We looked at a bus schedule and found the bus stop closest to our homes . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
We got to the bus stop ten minutes before our bus was supposed to arrive and waited . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
When it arrived , we got into the line to board . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the machine at the front of the bus . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
We had no token , so we gave the bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
We found a seat at the back of the bus and sat down . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
We checked our bus schedule and decided where we wanted to get off . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
When the sign at the front of the bus showed that it was our stop , we gathered our things and prepared to get off . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
After we got off , we made a note of which bus stop we were at and the time the bus would be there again to take us home . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Then we went off to explore the town . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The first time I took a bath , I enjoyed it so much that I did not want to stop . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
It felt like I was sitting in a pool of warm water . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I was a young kid so it was a bubble bath and I had some toys to play with . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Either my mother or my father would wash my hair for me then they would help me wash the remainder of my body . 	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
But they just told me not to splash the water and to keep the water in the tub . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I would play with my toys and get all clean in the bath tub . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After a few years I learned how to wash my own hair and I would prefer to take a bath over a shower since it was more fun to sit and relax in the warm water and enjoy a fun evening . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
From the best of my memory , I remember that I always loved taking a bath . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then when I am done in the bath tub , I would get out and wrap up in a huge dry cotton towel and dry off ! 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
Last summer , I decided I wanted to visit some family and friends of mine whom resided on the other side of the country . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I carefully considered my travel options and expenses , and decided it would be most economical to take the train . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Traveling by train is an easy and straight forward experience , but is also fun and enjoyable . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
To begin , I visited the railroad 's website and booked my ticket . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
The ticket was then sent to me via email , which I could print out or display on my mobile device . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
On the day of travel , I arrived at the train station about a half an hour early and waited for the train to arrive . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
When the train arrived , the conductor stepped off and asked for tickets . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I had elected to use my mobile device to display my ticket , so I showed the ticket to the conductor and he scanned it with his phone . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
I was then directed towards my assigned seat . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I settled in for the ride , with food and entertainment I had brought with me . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
For most of the ride however , I was glued to the window , enjoying the sights of town after town that we traveled through . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
The next day I arrived at my destination . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I gathered my bags and stepped off the train , knowing I would return again very soon . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
While I was out riding my bike one warm spring day , one of the tires went flat . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Fortunately I had a repair kit with me in a pouch on the bike . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I always kept it with me on rides just in case of such an occurrence . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I got off and went to the side of the trail out of the way of other bikers and runners . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I lay the bike on its side and got the repair kit out of the pouch . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
The repair kit contained a new inner tube which I inflated . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I then pulled the outer tire off of the inner tube . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I replaced the flattened inner tube with the new one and replaced the outer tire over it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I rode off slowly to make sure everything was correctly in place . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Once I got home , I replaced the spare tire kit with a new one so that I would be prepared on my next ride . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I was long overdue for a haircut so I made an appointment for Saturday . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I arrived I had to sit and wait a few minutes for the stylist to escort me to the chair . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I read a magazine while I waited . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
After the stylist greeted me she asked if I wanted the usual . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I did , so we went straight to the shampoo area . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
She shampooed my hair and we made small talk about television shows we were watching . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
then we went back to the chair and she commenced cutting . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
We chatted as she went . 	1 0 0 1 0 0
After the cut she styled my hair with product and blow dried it for me . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I asked to buy some of the product so she grabbed it and added it to my bill . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
when the haircut was done she walked me back to the counter where I paid and tipped her 20 percent . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
It had been a while since I had gotten a hair cut and decided it was time . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I found the number of the salon in the phone book and called to make an appointment . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then I drove to the salon . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My favorite stylist was there and she greeted me and had me sit down in a chair that was in her booth . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
She wrapped a plastic protector over me and bent the chair back . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Then she shampooed my hair . 	0 1 0 1 1 0
Then she combed my hair to get it ready to be cut . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Then she started cutting my hair with a special pair of scissors . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
She took her time about cutting my hair . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
When she was all done she grabbed a hair dryer and dried it . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I thanked her and went to the counter to pay . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I paid , left the shop and drove home . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Last night I had a meeting in the city . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I live about an hour train ride from the city . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
I got ready in my house and walked out of my house leaving plenty of time to get to my meeting on time . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I had to refill my metrocard with more money for the train fare . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
They have raised the train fares again . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
I enter the train station , payed for my metrocard at a machine , and walked down the stairs to wait for my train . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I need to take two trains so I will switch for another train at another stop . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
My train arrives quickly and I manage to get a seat because it was n't too busy . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
After getting off the first train and switching for another train 45 minutes later , I arrived at the destination and was on time for the meeting . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Now I have to repeat the commute home after the meeting and hope it will be as smooth . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I took a bath for the first time in a long time last week . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I wanted to be able to relax and get clean without all the work of standing up to shower ! 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
First , I made sure the bathtub was cleaned out . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I then ran the hot water first and filled up most of the bathtub . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I turned the hot water off and then turned the cold on , that way the temperature of the water was not too hot and not too cold , but just right . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I got a book that I had been wanting to read and climbed in . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
After reading for awhile , I decided that it was time to wash off since the water was starting to cool down . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I washed off my face and body , and then used shampoo and conditioner in my hair . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
When I was all done , I drained the water from the tub and used the shower to rinse off . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I dried myself off with a big towel and put on my pajamas so I would be comfortable . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I love to go work out at the gym . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I tend to lift for a long time until I 'm spent of any excess energy . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After that I 'll get on the arc trainer and start sweating a great deal . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I say this to illustrate the point that after this work out I am in great need of a bath . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I come home and welcome my ritual of taking a bath . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I get my phone out and find my favorite Pandora station that matches my current mood . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I then get the water rolling at a hot temperature . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I get undressed and in the tub . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I like to sit there for a while and reflect while I relax . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
After a few minutes I 'll lather my hair and clean it out . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
I might drain the tub and put in more water . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Lastly I 'll soap off the nastiness of the gym . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
In my english class I was recently assigned to read the book brave new world . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
My first idea was to just buy it but when I went to the local bookstore it cost $ 20 . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
$ 20 for a book is more than I am willing to pay so I decided to go to the local library . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Calling in ahead to make sure that they did indeed have the book that I wanted , I then headed in the direction of the library . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When I arrive they had already had the book up front as I requested so that all I had to do was go pick it up . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Or so I thought . 	0 0 1 0 0
In actuality I had to spend time getting a new library card . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
The librarian walked me through the process while also giving me a little background on the book I was about to read . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
After I had gotten my new library card I simply gave it to the librarian and she checked out the book for me . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Now it is time to dig in to this novel 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
I was running low on food , so I decided to take a trip to the grocery store . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
First I wrote down a list of everything I would need . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
Then I hopped in my car and drove over there . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I parked where I could find a space and headed into the store . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I grabbed a shopping cart and went over to the bread section . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
There I picked out a good loaf of bread . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After that , I looked at all the fruits and vegetables . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I picked out a bag of oranges and kept going . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
There were a few more items on the list , so I found each one and put them in my cart . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once I finished finding everything on my list , I went over to the check out lines . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I found a line with only one person in front of me , so I waited there . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
When it was my turn , I put my items on the conveyor belt . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then the cashier scanned my items and gave me a total . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I swiped my credit card and paid for my items . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
She then gave me a receipt , and I took my cart back to my car . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I unloaded my bags into my car , and put the cart back in the cart corral . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Finally , I drove home . 	0 0 1 0 1 0
Last weekend there was a parade in the downtown area of my city , and I decided to take my little sister - we had so much fun ! 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I 'm not old enough to drive and our parents were busy , so I decided to take the bus . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I went online and looked at the bus route to determine which stop let us off closest to the parade , and then I looked at the bus schedule to see what time the bus would come and how often it ran . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I also found out how much the ride costs , and Mom gave me the money I needed for both of us . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
The day of the parade my sister and I walked the two short blocks to the bus stop and waited inside the little bus shelter . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
When the bus came , the driver came to a stop and the doors opened and we walked up the two steps . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We said hello to the driver and paid the fare - my sister loved putting the coins in the fare box . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
We walked a few steps down the aisle and took a seat near the front of the bus and settled in to look out of the window . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The bus made a lot of stops and all types of people got on and off of the bus ; it was pretty noisy ! 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
When I could tell we were getting close to our stop , I pulled the chord to alert the driver that we were getting off at the next stop . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When we reached our stop , my sister and I walked down the aisle and off of the bus . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We were just in time to see the beginning of the parade ! 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Every time I have to go to the city , I have to take the train . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
One day , when I was on the train , I had to wait twenty minutes for the next train to arrive . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
When it arrived , , the place was full . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was full because it was rush hour . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
That 's the time when everyone is coming out of work or school . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I could n't find a seat at all ! 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I had to stand up throughout my whole ride . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
It was very uncomfortable because I had to stand up for an hour ride . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
To make matters worse , more people wanted to squeeze inside the train . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Now everybody was on top of one another . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Soon , the train could n't move anymore because there were just too many people on the train . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The door would n't close therefore ; the conductor could n't drive the train . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Eventually , people started to come out and I was able to breathe . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Finally , I reached my stop and was relieved to be out of that train . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
If you have a flat tire it is quite easy to change it yourself . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
The front tire is the easiest to change while the back will require more time and maybe additional tools . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
This is usually the back tire is where the chain and gears are connected to so it is harder to take off the bike frame . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Sadly , most of the time a flat tire is the back tire because the back tire supports most of your weight on a bicycle . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
So you 'll need a wrench to undo the bolts on both sides of the tire . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
This will allow you to take off the entire tire . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Inside the tire is an innertube , and this is the part you either need to replace or patch up . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
If it is a small hole and you can easily find the hole , you can use a tire patch kit to fix the hole . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Other wise you may just replace the entire innertube altogether . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Either way you will put the innertube back , and then the tire back onto the bike frame . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Lastly , screw back on the bolts and pump some air into the tire . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
You 'll be ready to ride soon after ! 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The last time I got a hair cut was a very long time ago . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I needed to look presentable to see my distant family . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I called up and made a reservation with the salon for four twenty five in the afternoon the next day . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The next day I went in and they asked me about what sort of haircut I wanted . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
I did not really know exactly what I wanted so I let them just give me a simple , regular haircut . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
They started by washing my hair by dipping my head into a sink , massaging the soap in , and finally washing it out . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
Next they dried my hair a little bit , but left it damp so it would be easier for them to cut . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Then they started cutting away using a combination of scissors and a razor . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
After about thirty minutes they asked me how I felt about my haircut , and since I approved , the cut was done . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
A few months ago , I took a train to Sacramento to visit my friend and her family . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
I had decided to take the train because Sacramento is 72 miles from the city I live in and I am not a good driver . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I ordered the train tickets online a week before my trip and wrote down my confirmation number . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
When I got to the train station , I went to a small self-service kiosk in the lobby and entered my personal information including my confirmation number , and printed out my train ticket . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
After that , I walked up to the platform and waited for my train . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
There were several electronic displays that said when the train would come , and I watched them impatiently . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
When the train arrived , I boarded behind another passenger and found a window seat so I could enjoy the view . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I also liked the seat because it had a table in front of it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I had a backpack with me which I put in the compartment above my seat . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I put my ticket on top of the table so it would be easy to find . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
A few minutes later , a worker came by to check passenger 's tickets , and after I showed him and he stamped it , I put my ticket in my pocket . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
There were not many people traveling so no one sat near me . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The train departed the station shortly after that . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I fell asleep on the train , but I woke up well before my stop . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
When the train stopped at my station , I grabbed my backpack and off boarded onto the platform . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then I went in to the train station and met my friend who had come to pick me up . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I went to the library to find books about making a set of wooden shelves . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I asked the librarian for help and she pointed me towards the right section . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I looked at all the books on woodworking until I found a few that I felt had the information I needed to build the shelves . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I took the books that I needed to the librarian and she told me that they now have a self-checkout . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
She showed me how the system worked and assigned me a pin code . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
They gave me a new library card that will let me use the self check out . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
So I scanned my library card and put in my pass code . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
I scanned each of the books i had chosen and then clicked on the button to print my receipt . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
This new system will make going to the library much faster . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I gathered my books and left the library and went home to start my book shelves . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
Late last week on my way home from work I got into an accident that damaged my car . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Luckily everyone who was involved came out uninjured but my car was damaged and would have to spend about two weeks in the shop . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Since my insurance did not cover a rent a car this meant that I had to take public transportation for the next couple of weeks to get to work . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I was fortunate to have a bus stop only a couple of blocks from my house so I would walk to the bus stop and wait for the bus with the other people . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Some people talked to one another and others like myself had headphones in , listening to music . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It is not that I am against talking to people I am just not really a morning person and do not feel like it at 7AM . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
The bus pulled up and we got in line to board and showed him our ticket to ride . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
I then grabbed a seat and gazed out the window until I reached my stop downtown . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
I got up , thanked the bus driver and got off the bus and started walking down the street to work . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
'' `` Planting A Tree '' '' Jenny and her Grandpa decided that early spring was a wonderful time to plant a new tree in the front yard . '' '' 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
What kind of tree will we plant Grandpa ? '' '' 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Jenny asked . 	1 0 0
Grandpa scratched his head . '' '' 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0
Hmmmm I do n't know Jenny '' '' he replied . '' 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
`` We need to decide what we will want the tree for . '' '' 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Jenny tilted her small head and asked '' `` What do you mean Grandpa ? 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
What can trees do ? '' '' 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Trees can do many things , provide shade , flowers or food just to name a few . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
things . '' '' 	1 0 0 0
They decided to take a ride to a plant nursery to look at all the small young trees . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Grandpa did not want the pine tree . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Even though it would stay green all year . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
He did not want the Lilac tree even though the flowers would smell so pretty in each spring . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Instead he picked a nice sized apple tree . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Jenny bounced with excitement . '' 	1 0 0 1 0 0
`` Grandpa we can pick apples soon ? '' '' 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
she exclaimed . '' 	1 0 0 0
`` Someday he said smiling down at her . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Grandpa brought the tree to the cashier and paid the fee for their tree and carefully loaded it into the back of his truck . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
At home grandpa got the tools they would need from his little gardening shed . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
A hose , watering can , shovel , two pairs of gardening gloves and a tiny shovel just right for Jenny 's helping hands . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After putting on their gardening gloves together they dug a hole five times larger than the root ball of the tree they had paid for at the nursery . 	0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Grandpa gently turned the small tree upside down to remove it from the pot it had been growing in . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
He told Jenny it was important to now plant the small tree right away so it 's tender rooms did not dry out . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
He placed the roots into the hole they has dug and made sure the top of the root ball was level with the ground and that they tree was standing straight and tall . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Together they filled in the rest of the hole around the trees roots . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Jenny helped grandpa filled the watering can with water from the hose and she watched proudly as grandpa watered their newly planted apple tree . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Jenny was full of pride watching the small young trees leave blowing in the cool early spring breeze . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I decided my backyard needed another tree . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
So I went to the tree nursery and picked out a tree that I liked . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I rented a pickup truck to bring the tree home . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I loaded the tree into the truck and drove it to my house . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I grabbed a shovel from my garage , and I dug a hole in my backyard where I wanted the tree to go . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I poured some special tree fertilizer into the hole that I had bought from the tree nursery . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I then asked a friend to help me , because the tree was very big and heavy . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Together we placed the tree in the hole . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I then started to fill up the dirt around the tree . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Halfway through filling it , I took a garden hose and poured water down the hole . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When the water settled , I finished filling in the dirt . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Over the dirt I placed a nice bed of mulch around the tree . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I watered the tree once more , then stepped back to admire my work . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Now that winter is over , our planting season has begun . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Last weekend , I went out and bought a small apple tree . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I found a perfect spot in my back yard for it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0
First I looked around and decided even if it grew very large , it would n't run into any other trees or power lines . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Next I got to work with my tiller , cutting into the earth and churning up the dirt . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once everything was loosened , I took my shovel and dig a hole . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I gently placed the small young tree into that spot , burying it 's roots in the hole I had dug . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I added some coffee grounds to the soil around the roots , and then took my shovel and got to work covering the roots up again . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Finally , I smoothed the dirt with my shovel and went to get my garden hose . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
A new tree needs water ! 	0 0 1 0 1 0
I watered the ground beneath ot . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Smiling , I admired the small but sturdy tree in my yard that will someday be a large tree that gives us fruit . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I had to bake a cake for a birthday party . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I took out the ingredients and put them on the counter : flour , sugar , eggs , vanilla , salt , baking soda , and milk . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I then turned on the oven , setting it at 375 degrees . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
While it was preheating , I got to work . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I mixed the wet ingredients together in a big bowl , and then slowly started adding the dry ingredients . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I used a blender to stir the ingredients together . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
When they were all mixed together , the batter was ready . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was the consistence of thick maple syrup . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I sprayed spray oil on the inside of a pan and then poured the cake batter into the pan . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
It was ready to go . 	1 0 0 0 0 0
When the oven beeped to let me know that it was finished preheating , I put the pan into the oven . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I put on a timer for 12 minutes . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
When the timer went off , I opened the oven door and took the pan out . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I inserted a toothpick into the center of the cake and took it out to see if the cake was done : the toothpick came out without any batter attached to it , so the cake was good to go . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I turned off the oven and left the cake in the pan on the counter to cool . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
After a while I moved the cake to a cooling rack . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
When it was completely cool I covered it with chocolate frosting and wrote '' `` Happy Birthday ! '' '' 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
on the top with a tube of blue icing . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The cake looked great ! 	0 1 0 0 0
I was excited to go home for the holidays last December , but I was less excited about having to take an airplane ! 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I normally would drive , but my mother persuaded me to take a plane because she was afraid I would have to drive through snow . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I filled a single suitcase with as many necessities I could fit , because I did not want to have to deal with putting multiple suitcases through the luggage handler . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I arrived at the airport and waited in line to check in . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I let the TSA search me for any contraband that would not be allowed on the plane , and then waited to be allowed to board . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once we were let on the plane , I walked over to my seat and shoved my suitcase into the overhead compartment . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
Luckily it fit , so I would be able to keep it with me . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I snuggled into my seat and tried to ignore the butterflies in my stomach . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Flying always makes me nervous . 	0 0 0 1 0 0
The person seated directly next to me was a middle aged woman flying alone . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
She gave me a sympathetic smile and asked me if I was as nervous as she was . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I said yes , and I think we both felt better that at least we would be good seatmates . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The plane ride was uneventful ; after five hours in the air , we landed at our destination in one piece . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Yesterday I had to go across town to the library to return some books . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
All my friends were busy and my car was in for repairs , so I had to take the bus . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
First thing was to see what bus I needed . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
I went over to my computer and pulled up the bus schedules for my city . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
I found the nearest bus stop and checked the bus lines that stopped there , then looked for the stop nearest the library . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
There was a bus that went to both stops , so I would n't have to change buses to get there . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Next I found the next time the bus would be at the stop near my house , which was only 15 minutes from now . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I grabbed the books and headed out to walk to the bus stop . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I got to the stop about 5 minutes early and waited for the bus to arrive . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was only 2 minutes late , which is n't too bad . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I climbed into the bus , paid the driver and found an empty seat . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It was a pretty nice day , so I just sat there looking out the window until we got to the stop by the library . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I got off the bus and went inside to return my books . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
It was a good bus ride , no problems with traffic at all . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
The other day , I decided to ride the bus to work since my car had broken down . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
It was a cold day in January as the rain had just fallen the night before . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I sat nearby the rear-door of the bus and felt he air-conditioner blowing onto my neck and watched the street signs to see how much further my stop was going to be . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
I had been riding on the bus for approximately 15 minutes and stopped three times so far . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
We came upon a busy intersection where the bus stop was crowded with what appeared to be fifteen or so people huddled by the bench area waiting to get on . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Slowly the people in queue walked onto the bus steps and piled into each available space as quickly as they could . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
After driving for two more blocks , I noticed my stop and pressed the button to signal the driver to drop me off . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I stood up from my seat and headed to the door and left to go to work . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
For a long time , I was planning to read a book about stock trading . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
When I went online most of the books were quite expensive . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
But there was a library very close to my house . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
That lead me to think about borrowing one book from the library . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
One Saturday morning I went there and browsed several books . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I spent almost 2 hours to finalize a book . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Finally I stood in the line for the check out counter . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
When it was my turn , I gave the person at the counter the book that I chose . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
They asked me for the membership card but that is when I realized that I did n't have one . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I decided to apply for a new membership card . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
All that was needed for the membership application was my ID card . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0
I gave them my driving license . 	1 0 1 1 1 1 0
I was given a new membership card within 5 minutes . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I used it to borrow the book that I selected . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I was told that the book needs to be returned within 7 days . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Overall the experience was a nice one and I would keep going there . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Today I am going to ride a train to visit my grandmother . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
We are going to visit for my birthday . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
We left our home and drove in our car to the train station . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
We then went up to the counter and bought two tickets to ride the train to my grandmother 's town . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
We had to wait for twenty minutes in the station before it was time to board our train . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
When it was time , we went over to the train and handed our tickets to a man in a uniform that works on the train . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
He checked our tickets and helped us up onto the train . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
We then found a seat and enjoyed the ride . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
We saw many interesting things on our way to see my grandmother . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
The train moved very fast along the tracks . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We arrived at our destination quickly . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0
When the train pulled into the station , we saw my grandmother waiting there for us ! 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
One time I drove over a piece of glass and it put a hole into my bicycle tire . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
I had to walk my bicycle all the way home , which was very unpleasant , and then I could not use my bike again until I had fixed it . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
So I looked up online how to fix a punctured tire , and went to the hardware store to pick up the necessary tools . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After purchasing these tools I pumped some air into the tire to locate the hole and then I took the tire off of the wheel to repair it . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I followed the directions on the repair kit which were actually very simple . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
After I had patched the hole , I waited for the adhesive material to dry and then I took the bike out for a short test run to make sure that if the tire failed again I would not be far from home . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Some years ago , I used my bike to get around town a lot . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Of course , came the time when you have to make repairs . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I found out a lot about bicycle tires during this time . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
My tire had a leak so I bought a repair kit . 	1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I had no idea how to use it but I did find out . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I had to take the whole wheel off the bicycle . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Next I pried the tires from the rim and that took some doing . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Okay once I got that off I had to take the inner tube out also and I learned that I had to be very careful with the inner tube because I could cause more damage by being rough . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Next , I took the inner tube to the gas station to get air since I did n't have a manual air pump . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I learned really quickly that I needed to fill the inner tube with care or I would be buying another one since the air fills it quickly and the tube can pop . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once I put a little air in the tube I had to listen as I pressed the air out to determine where the leak was actually at . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Once the leak location was identified then I was able to take the tube home and use the glue from the kit and apply the rubber patch . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Of course I had to allow the tube to dry and then deflate it to get it back on the bicycle . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Once I got it all put back together I walked my bike back to the gas station for air . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
My hair was getting long and it was getting hard to style it . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It looked like it was time to get a haircut . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I called the hair salon to see if I could get an appointment with my favorite hairdresser . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
She told me she could see me that afternoon at 3pm . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I drove to the salon , parked my car and went in . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I sat down on one of the chairs in the waiting area . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
There were several other people waiting to see their hairdresser . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
There was an assortment of magazines on a table in the center of the waiting area . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
My hairdresser was still working on another client , so I picked up a magazine to read while I waited my turn . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
When she was ready for me I walked over to her station and sat down . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
The chair was operated by hydraulics , and she adjusted the height so she could reach my head easily . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
There was a large mirror in front of the chair , and a small shelf that held combs , brushes , and other tools . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
She placed a white tissue around my neck and then a black plastic cape which covered my shoulders , back and front . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
She then squirted a liquid from a spray bottle over my hair to wet it and combed it through . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Although she has been cutting my hair for quite a while , she asked how I would like my hair cut since I might have decided to change the style . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I told her what I wanted she began to hold up sections of my hair in her fingers , using a small scissors to cut each piece . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
When my entire head of hair was cut , she took a blow dryer and brush and dried and styled my hair . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
When she was finished she gave me a small hand mirror and turned my chair around so I could see the back of my hair in the reflection of the large mirror . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I was happy with the way it came out and told her so . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
She then removed the cape and tissue and we went to the front of the salon where I paid her for the cost of the haircut . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
She put the money in a cash register and I gave her some extra money as a tip , since I was so pleased with how my hair looked . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
Traveling by train is almost like traveling by airplane . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I learned that the train companies have baggage limits , rules for unaccompanied minors , and seating rules too . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I bought my ticket ahead of time and then went to my station . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
They checked my ticket , ID , baggage , and I hopped on the train . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The process to check my bags was so similar to flying . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I packed a small bag to carry with me but I could have packed a larger bag that would be checked . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
No sharp objects , self defense items , and many other things were not allowed . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Seating on my train was first come first serve basis . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I was told if there was any concerns from passengers , seating could be assigned ! 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
My trip was n't very long so I did n't have a meal but I brought some snacks and a drink with me . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Before I knew it , I had arrived at my destination . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I really like traveling by train . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was going to meet up with my friends at the mall to watch a new movie that recently came out . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
But , since the mall is pretty far away , I needed to take the bus . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
So , I went online to the bus ' site to check the time that the Mall Route bus would be near my house . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I marked the times down on my phone and got ready to leave . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I sent a text to my friends and let them know that I could make it and that I 'd been there soon . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I grabbed my jacket , wallet , and made sure to get my bus pass . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
I checked the time and set off . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I walked a few blocks to the bus stop and double checked the time . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I had to wait for a little bit , but it 's always better to get to the stop early , since sometimes the bus is n't quite on schedule . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
The bus finally pulled up and I got on . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I swiped my card and I found a decent seat . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Luckily , there were n't that many people on board and the stops were short . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
As the bus got closer to the mall , and it was nearing the stop , I pulled on the line that let the driver know that she needed to let someone off . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I made it to the mall in good time and got to hang out with my friends a bit before the movie . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
It was a pretty good day . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
'' `` Going grocery shopping '' '' Going to the grocery for me is kind of a burden . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I like going ahead and getting everything I need for at least two weeks . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The longer I can wait to have to go back , the better . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I normally go to two different stores . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
One is a traditional grocery store and the other is a dollar store . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
When I go to the traditional grocery store , I get frustrated because I find it hard to find certain things . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Baking soda is an example . 	1 1 0 0 1 0
One day , I asked an employee who was working in the baking supplies isle where the baking soda was . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
We could not find it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
Again , this was on the baking supplies isle . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
As I walk through the store looking for things I need , I 'll see a display of chips or something at the end of an isle . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
This makes me think that there are chips on that isle . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
There are no chips on that isle . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
It 's a good trip when I have everything I need for a few weeks . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Today I decided to bake a cake so we could have it for dessert with tonight 's dinner . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I thought a chocolate cake would be nice , so I took out my cookbook and looked for a recipe for chocolate cake . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
There were a few different chocolate cake recipes , but I picked one that was called devil 's food cake . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The recipe had a list of ingredients , so I checked my cupboard to make sure I had everything I would need . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0
When I was sure I did , I got out 2 mixing bowls and a cake pan . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
The recipe said to preheat the oven to 350 degrees , so I turned the oven on and set the temperature for 350 . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then I took a bit of butter and rubbed it all over the inside of the cake pan . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
That would make sure the cake did n't stick in the pan and I would be able to get it out without any trouble . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I got out my electric mixer and put the beaters in , then plugged the mixer in the electrical outlet . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
As I read the directions from the recipe , I put the butter and sugar in one of the bowls . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put the beaters in the bowl and turned on the electric mixer , holding it really tightly as it mixed the butter and sugar until it was fluffy . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I cracked some eggs , and added them to the bowl and beat that some more . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
In another bowl I mixed flour , baking powder , cocoa powder and all the rest of the dry ingredients . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then I mixed the wet ingredients with the dry ones and mixed them all together with the electric mixer until the batter was smooth . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
When it was , I poured the batter in my cake pan and put it in the oven . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The recipe said it would take 30 minutes to cook , so I looked at the clock in my kitchen to see what time it was . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
Then I added 30 minutes to the time and knew when my cake would be ready . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
When 30 minutes was up , I opened the oven and looked at the cake . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It looked done , but to be sure I took a toothpick and stuck it in the middle of the cake . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
If it came out clean , I 'd know the cake was done . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
If it came out full of wet cake batter , it was not done yet , and would need a bit longer to cook . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
The toothpick came out clean . 	0 1 0 0 0 0
My cake was done . 	1 1 0 0 0
I put on a potholder glove so I would n't get burned and removed the cake from the oven . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I put it on a wire rack on my kitchen counter so it could cool off before I tried to take it from the pan . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When it was cool , I flipped the pan over onto the rack and the cake fell out of the pan . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It looked good , and I knew everyone would enjoy the chocolate cake that night at dinner . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
Yesterday , I noticed my yard did not have any shade , so I decided to plant a tree . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
First , I went to the garden store and bought a sapling ; a baby tree . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I took the sapling home and surveyed my yard for the best place to plant it . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I choose a sunny spot right in the middle of my backyard . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I then took a shovel and dug into the earth at the spot I decided on . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I dug a little hole in that area . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I unwrapped the root of the sapling and placed it in the small hole that I had dug . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
Then I used a spade to fill in the dirt around the tree root , so that the roots were totally covered by dirt . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I added a little fertilizer in the dirt around the roots so that the tree would grow big and strong . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I stepped back and looked at my new tree and was so happy that the task was accomplished . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
One day that sapling will grow into a large tree and provide shade to my backyard . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
A the church summer camp I volunteer at it was decided that we should try to make the campus more sustainable as well as beautiful . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Planting fruit bearing trees was thought to be a good way to achieve these goals as well as letting the participants learn more about where food sources come from . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
Research was done into finding trees that would bear fruit in the season that the camp was most used . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
as well as having the requirements of water and sunlight and soil work with the land at camp . 	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Several trees were ordered , including a cherry tree . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
In the chosen location a hole was dug and the tree had the burlap removed from the root ball and it was placed in at the appropriate depth . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The soil with a few amendments was replaced and grass seed was sprinkled on . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
The tree was watered as suggested and I was assigned to schedule future watering and monitor the tree for health and insect invasions . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
In September 2012 , I rode and flew in an airplane on my way back home from my parents ' country of birth , the Philippines . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I rode two different planes , but this one will be about the second one , the trip on the way back to the United States . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I was in Narita International Airport and boarding my second flight . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I forgot which airline it was . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0
But like one would normally do , I waited in line , showed the boarding attendant my ticket and passport , and headed to the tunnel connecting the building and the plane . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
As I headed for my seat , I tried looking at the seat numbers on the compartments above them . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I found mine , and opened the compartment to put my carry-on in . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
I sat down and tried to make myself comfortable . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
In about 15 minutes , we were ready for take-off . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The flight attendant made some announcements , and we were set . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I was seated by the window , as I always do . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I love sitting by the window . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
The view is awe-inspiring when you ' re that high . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I decided to open up a fresh set of earphones and browsed the media player in front of me , and watched Avengers . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
My viewing was interrupted when dinner was being served . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
I love airport food as well , for the most part . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It ' s not always the best , but most of the time I like it . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
After eating , I finished the movie and fell asleep . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
For the rest of the flight , I saw clouds , sunshine , and other planes , and by nighttime , we landed in New York , at the JFK International airport . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0

Yesterday , I went to get a haircut . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
When I walked into the salon , a lady named Sara came over and told me to follow her to the shampoo station . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I sat in a chair and another lady named Marsha washed my hair and put a towel around my head . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
She then took me over to Sara who asked me to sit in her chair and put a cape around my neck . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Next Sara asked me how short I wanted my hair . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I told her I still wanted it to be a little past my shoulders , therefore , she should only cut off about 1 inch . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
She told me that was fine and began cutting my hair . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
It took her about twenty minutes to cut an inch off of all of my hair . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
After she cut it , she took the blow dryer out and dried my hair . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Then she curled it with a curling iron . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
It looked really great ! 	1 0 0 0 0
So I paid her for cutting my hair and told her how much I appreciated the great job that she did for me ! 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I was riding my bike around my house and noticed I had to peddle harder than I usually do . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I got off my bike to see if everything was wrong . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
The front tire looked okay , the chain was still on the bike , but the back tire was flat unfortunately . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I walked my bike back to my house because it is not safe to ride a bike with a flat tire . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I went in my garage and looked for the air pump . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I connected the valve of the pump to the valve on the tire . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I pumped the air pump and kept checking the tire to make sure it was working . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
It was hard work and it took longer than I thought . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Eventually , the tire seemed full with air . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I put my ear next to it to see if I could hear any air coming out but I did n't hear any . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I got back on my bike and it rode fine . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0
The other day , I finished reading the fourth book of the Game of Thrones Series . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
With the new season about to start on HBO , I wanted to get ahead of the show and continue reading the books in the series -- but I did not want to pay for the next book . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Remembering that I had a library card somewhere in my desk at home , I went home and found it . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I went to the library and after browsing the fiction section , I finally found the fifth book in the series and brought it to the check out desk of the library . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I handed over my information and library card and checked out the book , getting two weeks to read it for free . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
I 'm now a quarter of the way through the book and enjoy every page of it while loving the fact that my taxes paid for me to read this and I had to pay no extra money . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Every night before putting my son to bed he gets his bath . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
we go up to the bathroom and I start the water and add his favorite bubbles . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
After he is undressed he stands next to the tub and giggles and dances watching the running water create a mass of bubbles ! 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I make sure the water is warm enough , because his baths tend to last a bit longer than most . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
When the water is ready , he throws in all his tub toys , lizards and dinosaurs , cups and cars . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
The cars are his under water taxi 's for the fish , he says . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
He sits amiss the bubbles playing with his toys and laughing . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
We do the toe test , which is when i look at his toes and if they are wrinkle then time is up . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Yup toes are wrinkled , he laughs as wash his body and hair . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I let the water out as he sits there and waits for the tub to empty , only then does he want to get out . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
He helps to dry himself off and put his pajamas on . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
Now it is time for bed . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0
For my 13th birthday I decided I 'd bake my own cake instead of having my Mom buy one for me . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0
To keep it simple my Mom bought a Betty Crocker cake mix . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Once my friends arrived we gathered in the kitchen to make the cake . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The first thing we did was set the stove to the temperature indicated on the box . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

You 're going to be digging quite a large hole , so you need to consider a few things . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

Yesterday I went to the nursery and bought a baby apple tree about three feet tall . 	1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
I 've always loved apple trees . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I carried it home in my pickup truck . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0

After about 15 minutes I started to refill the dirt around the tree . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After packing the dirt down , I saturated the ground around the tree with water . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0

After a long day at school followed by soccer practice , taking a bath is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable parts of my day . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
First , I fill the tub with warm water . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I like the water to be the perfect temperature ; not too hot , but not too cold . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

I allowed the tub to fill about two-thirds of the way full and stepped inside . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I sank into the warm water with a sigh . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The water felt great and helped me relax . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I grabbed a wash cloth from the side of the tub and rubbed the soap against the cloth . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I worked it into a rich lather and preceded to wash my entire body from the head down . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0

The bus fare is cheaper than a taxi . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
In my city , it costs $ 2.00 to ride . 	0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
First , I waited at the bus stop near to my house . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
When the bus stopped for me , I walked up the steps , which are pretty high . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I said hello to the bus-driver and he gave me a friendly smile . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I paid my fare went to look for a seat . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
There are usually a lot of people riding , but today it was pretty empty . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
The bus began to move , so I had to get my footing . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I saw a good corner spot in the back and made my way . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I was hanging onto the poles because I did not want to fall over when the bus started to pick up speed . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
There was an older woman who I passed and she had about two bags with her and she was humming a quiet song . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

I sat down , got a book out and read for a little while . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
People got on and off the bus while we drove . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
It was a little bumpy . 	1 0 0 0 0 0
I knew my stop was coming up when I saw the mall . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The bus ride took about thirty minutes . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0

I had just finished eating my lunch and knew it was time to go grocery shopping for the week . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I always buy my groceries all at one time for the week and then cook everything over the weekend so that I do n't have to cook on a daily basis . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0

I found a parking space close to the entrance because I knew I was going to buy a lot . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I got out of the car , walked through the store doors , and grabbed a shopping cart along the way . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I made my way down the fruit and vegetable aisles first , picking up bananas , oranges , salad mix , and kale along the way . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I then added some fish , chicken , hamburger meat , and pork to my cart . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Moving along down the aisles , I picked up all the dairy goods , spices , and snacks I would need for the week . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

The cashier bagged my groceries as I paid . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0

Today is my friend 's birthday so I decided I wanted to bake a cake for her . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
First , I went to the grocery store and bought all the ingredients I would need to make the cake like flour , eggs , oil , sugar and butter . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I also bought some candles to put on top of the cake once it was done . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
Then I went home and headed for the kitchen . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I preheated the oven so it would be hot and ready for the cake and then got out my bowls and measuring cups and spoons . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl then got out a cake pan and greased it with butter so the cake would not stick , poured the cake batter in the pan and put the pan in the oven to bake . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0

When I saw my friend later that day , I lit the candles and sang Happy Birthday to her . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
She really liked her cake . 	1 0 0 1 1 0
Friday was Madison 's birthday party and I wanted to make sure that I looked my best . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I asked my dad to take me to the local barber shop . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
When I got there , I sat down and saw that there were two other people waiting . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I decided to go over to the magazine rack and I found a magazine about baseball . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I really enjoyed all of the stories that were in the magazine . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Before I knew it , the barber called me over to the chair . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I sat down and then he asked me what kind of haircut I wanted . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
It was summer so I decided to get a crew cut . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
He started off by using the electric razor on my head . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
After that , he got out the scissors in order to cut some of the remaining hair . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
After he finished , he put some powder on my face and brushed off any hair that had fallen . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
He showed me the haircut in a mirror and I was pleased . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I was riding my bicycle down a beautiful country road on a sunny , summer day . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
When all of a sudden , I felt something was wrong . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
I stopped my bike , got off and looked down . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
My front tire had gone flat . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I must have ridden over something sharp to puncture it . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
So I pulled out my gear bag that I had strapped to my bike . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I found an extra rubber tire liner and the tools needed to repair it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I took the wheel off my bike so it would be easier to work on . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I removed the punctured rubber tire liner from the wheel . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I replaced it with the new one using my tools . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I then used a special little cartridge I had brought with me that was filled with pressurized carbon dioxide to pump my new tire up . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
Once it was done , I placed it back on my bike and continued on with my ride . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Today I found out my bike tire was flat right before I needed to ride it to work . 	1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I hurriedly flipped the bike upside down and sat it on the seat . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I pulled quick release bolt on the tire and unscrewed it . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I disconnected the brakes and removed the wheel from the bike . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I then used the tire removal tool so that I could get to the inner tube . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I removed the inner tube , and examined where the hole might be . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I could not find the hole so I put it into the sink with water . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
I found the tiny hole in the tube . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I used glue and a chunk of rubber from an old inner tube to fix the puncture . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I had to let it dry for a few minutes . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put the inner tube back onto the rim , and then put the tire back onto the rim . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I fit the tire back onto the bike and screwed the tire on and rode to work . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I was very excited to go on a train trip . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I went over to the ticket counter and gave the teller the money I had saved for my ticket . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
I could hardly wait until the train finally arrived . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I climbed aboard , put my suitcases next to all the other people 's suitcases , and found a seat . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Once the train started going , the conductor came by to punch everyone 's tickets . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I gladly handed him mine to be punched . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
After that , I decided I would get some lunch . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I walked to the back of the train to the lunch car and ordered some food . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
It was fun to eat while watching the world pass by through the window as the train rolled down the tracks . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Before I knew it , we had arrived at the destination . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I gathered up my things , grabbed my suitcase , and climbed down out of the train as the conductor gave me a hand . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
It had been a very fun trip , and I ca n't wait to ride again . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
I needed to learn about gardening and was n't sure where to start . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
A friend of mine recommended a book . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I decided to check it out from the local library . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I walked to the library . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
Inside there was a computer to look up where books are located . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I typed in the name of the book I was looking for and it showed me the call number , a unique number used to tell where the book is located in the library . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I wrote the call number down and looked at the stacks of books . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Each stack had a range of numbers printed on a card taped to the side of the bookshelf . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I looked for my call number on the printed cards on the side of the bookshelves , then searched the books until I found the one I was looking for . 	1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I brought the book up to the front of the library . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
The librarian took my library card and scanned it and my book with a special scanner . 	0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
She gave me a piece of paper inside the book that said I needed to bring it back within 2 weeks . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

Yesterday was a long and stressful day . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
From start to finish , it felt like nothing could possibly go right . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
On days like those , I really love a nice bubble bath to relax and wash off the stress , so that is what I did . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I gathered up a towel , body wash , shampoo , conditioner , bubble bath and a few candles and walked into my bathroom to take a nice , long bath . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I lit the cinnamon-scented candles , turned on the water to make sure it would be warm before I stepped in , then I dropped a little bit of the bubble bath in the water to create a gentle lather . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I sank into the bubbles and took a deep breath . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
It felt amazing to get to relax after such a rough day . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
The candles made the whole bathroom smell great and the water was awesome on my skin . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
Finally , I shampooed my hair and washed myself , then toweled off and put on my pajamas to get ready for bed . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Two weeks ago I went on a vacation to Florida . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Getting there meant having to fly in an airplane ! 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I arranged for a friend to drive me to the airport , and drop me off at the door near check in . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
I pulled a suitcase on wheels behind me and swung my small carry on bag over my shoulder . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once inside I followed signs and made my way to my airlines luggage drop off area . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
A man weight my suitcase , put a sticker on it , and whisked it out of my sight . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then I printed a boarding pass and made my way to the security line . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
There I waited until my turn , showed the security agent my ID card and went to the walk through metal detector . 	0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
Finally , I could make my way to my gate where I waited to be called to board . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once on board the plane I found my seat number and settled in comfortably . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
Before I knew it we were in the air . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0

Last year I visited my friend across the country . 	0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I live in California and he lives in North Carolina . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
I knew that I was n't going to drive all that way ; I needed a more efficient option . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided to start looking up how much a flight would cost . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
I researched what airlines provided flights from the airport nearest to where I live . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I then had to decide when exactly I wanted to fly there and back , as some days can be cheaper than others . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We settled on the dates that worked best for both of us , and I booked the cheapest flight I could find for a round-trip ticket . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
When it was time for my trip , I packed my bags and coordinated with a friend to give me a ride to the airport . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
My friend picked me up early enough so that by the time we got to the airport , I would be about an hour and a half early for my flight . 	1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I then had to check in and go through security . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Because I only had one small suitcase , I did not have to check my bags . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I waited in the terminal for my flight to arrive , reading a book to pass the time . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
When the plane landed from the previous flight , I also had to wait for those passengers to unload . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
They began calling different sections to board , and mine was one of the last ones . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I easily found my seat and stowed my suitcase in the compartment above . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0
I was sitting in the middle row , and the other two passengers next to me were already in their seats . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
When I got seated , I went ahead and buckled my seat belt and awaited take off . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The flight attendants had to make all their checks and when it was time to go , we also had an overview of the emergency procedures . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I did n't have too much room between myself and the seat in front of me , but there was a little tray on the back of that seat which I put down to use to hold the drink I ordered later . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I made small talk with the passengers next to me and we shared our travel plans . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
It was overall a decent flight , and we made good time and arrived with no issues . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
We were running out of milk , so I made a list of other groceries we needed and drove to the store . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I picked out a cart and went down the produce aisle first , picking out bananas and strawberries as I went . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
Lettuce , carrots , and zucchini were next on the list . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I wanted to buy ice cream , but was afraid it would melt , so I passed the freezer aisle and went straight for the bread . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
It 's nice to have good fresh bread for sandwiches , is n't it ? 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Then came the cereal aisle . 	0 0 0 1 1 0
Oatmeal would make a good change for breakfast . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Next came the dairy section : yogurt , cheese , butter and eggs were all on the list along with the milk that brought me to the store . 	0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0

On the weekend I planted an apple an apple tree . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
first , I put on gardening gloves to protect my hands . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
Next , I used a small shovel to dig a hole in a patch of dirt in my backyard . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0
I then took an apple seed and placed it inside the hole . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Next , I took the soil that I had dug out earlier and placed it on top of the seed , creating a thin layer of soil on top of the seed . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0

When the can was full , I brought it back over to the patch of dirt where the apple seed was planted , and I gently poured the water from the watering can onto the patch of dirt , watering my newly-planted apple seed . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

We decided the best way to get there would be an airplane . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

I do n't really like to fly on an airplane and I thought taking a train would be a great way for my young sons to see the country . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

I had ridden over a nail and my tire was punctured and my tube popped . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0

Once we noted the location of the hole we took the tube out of the tub and dried it . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
To put on the patch we had to put a glue on the tube and then put on the patch . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
We held it there a few minutes to make sure it would stay , then we let it sit for an hour to make sure the glue would dry . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

'' After playing football with my friends , I was all sweaty and dirty , so I decide I should take a bath . 	0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0

I waited with the other passengers until it was time to board the airplane . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
We then walked in a line through the doors , down a long hallway , and into the airplane . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
On the airplane I found my seat . 	0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
The airplane taxied down the runway and took off . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
After a long while , the flight attendant passed out beverages and snacks to everyone . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I drank my beverage , ate my snack and fell asleep . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
When I woke up we were landing . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
We had to taxi down the runway and wait until a gate was available . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
Once the airplane had stopped , the signal came on that we could take our seat belts off and get up . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
The doors open and we all exited off the plane . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Some tubs have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close it . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
After it 's closed I like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then I let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
While the water is running , I squirt in bubbles and make sure I have a clean washcloth and towel . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After I carefully climb into the tub , I make sure I wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then I can either soak and relax in the tub or I can play with toys . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
Fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
Once the water starts to turn a little cold , it 's time to get out so I open the drain again and let the water empty out . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
While it 's draining I carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
I always be sure the tub is clean when I 'm finished , with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Brandons hair was long . 	1 1 0 0 0
It flopped in his eyes . 	1 0 0 1 1 0
It blew it in the wind . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0
He was annoyed at school when he had to push it out of the way to see his paper . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
So him and his mommy decided to go see the barber . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Brandon loved the barber and his silly jokes and chit chat . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
He liked listening to the men talk . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
When Brandon got to the barber he lead him to the hair washing sink . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
He sat him in the chair that tilted back into the sink and laid back as the barber washed his hair . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
The water was just right , Never too hot or cold . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Next they walked over to the hair cutting chair . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Brandon loved it when the barber pumped his chair way up high and he could see himself in the large mirror in front of him . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The barber asked Brandon how he would like his hair cut and mommy told him just how they like it . 	0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then he wrapped a big cape around Brandon to protect him from hair clippings . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
Once his hair was towel dried and combed well . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Snip , snip , snip , went the scissors . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Brandon held very still . 	1 0 0 0 0
The barbers chair is a place even for little boys to be still and Brandon knew that . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
He watched as his hair fell to the floor . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Soon the barber spun him around in the chair and Brandon saw his new hair cut . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
It was smooth and neat . 	1 0 0 0 0 0
After another comb through and a few more snips of the scissors he was all done . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
Off came the cape . 	0 0 0 1 0
Brandons mommy paid the barber and tipped him for a job well done . 	1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
Brandon was glad for his hair cut . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
I made sure to look up the train schedule in advance to make sure I knew which train I needed to check . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
Then , I went a day early to purchase my tickets to made sure I had them , since this was not a trip I made every day . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
On the day of my trip , I checked the schedule to make sure there were no delays or cancellations . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I made sure to arrive at the train station at least 10 minutes early , with all my bags and luggage . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I boarded the train and greeted the conductor and showed him my ticket . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
Then , I picked a spot that was open and sat down quietly . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Since this train had many stops , I needed to be aware of when my stop was coming up so I would not miss it . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
As my stop approached , I pressed the stop request button and started to get up . 	0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
Once the train stopped , I wished the conductor a nice day and got off the train . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I decided to bake a special cake for my mother 's birthday . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
I gathered ingredients from my pantry that I had purchased earlier in the week . 	1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I turned on the oven to let it preheat before starting to combine ingredients . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I took out a huge metal bowl from the cabinet , along with a wooden spoon and mixer to help mix the ingredients . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put eggs , flour , sugar , cocoa powder , and butter into the metal bowl and mixed it with the electric mixer . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Then , I took out a food processor from the cabinet along with a carton of raspberries from the fridge . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
I dumped all of the raspberries into the food processor along with a few spoonfuls of water and then turned it on . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I watched the raspberries become a smooth liquid . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I poured the liquid into the big bowl with the rest of the ingredients . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I took out a square pan and greased it with the butter wrapper , and then put a light dusting of flour on the pan . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
Next , I poured the cake batter in the square pan and it was just enough . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0
I put the pan into the oven and after about an hour , the cake was finished baking perfectly . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I turned the oven off , and waited for the cake to cool for a few minutes . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then , I spread a jar of chocolate icing around the cake while it was still in the pan . 	0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I put it into the fridge and waited for my mother to get home . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
When I was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the Arbor Day holiday . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
Part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
The tree I had was some kind of evergreen tree and I planned to plant it in the front yard . 	0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I asked my Dad where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees . 	1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
In order to plant it I read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree . 	0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
It was a small tree so this was not a big hole . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I then tried to make the hole a good shape before putting in some moss and fill dirt . 	1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
The tree grew and became quite large . 	0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
The one thing I did n't realize is that I should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
Baking a Birthday Cake For an Awesome Nephew It was the day before my nephew 's third birthday . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I wanted to bake him a very special birthday cake . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
He loves tractors and anything related to farms , so I wanted to include that when I decorated the cake . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I decided to make a cake with three layers since he was going to be three years old . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
I started by finding recipes for both chocolate and yellow cake since I knew that those were his favorites . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I made the batter for the chocolate cake in one bowl and then the batter for the yellow cake in another bowl . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I poured some chocolate cake batter in the largest and the smallest round baking pans since the top and bottom layers would be chocolate . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I poured yellow cake batter in the medium-sized round baking pan since it would be the middle layer . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
I baked all three cakes and then cooled them . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After they cooled , I stacked the cakes according to size and I frosted the bottom and top layers with yellow frosting and the middle layer with green frosting . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I decorated the top of the cake with farm animals , a small toy tractor and the words , '' `` Happy Birthday Samuel . '' '' 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
I topped off the cake with a number 3 candle . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
My nephew was very happy when he saw the cake . 	1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
He was very surprised that I had baked a cake for him . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
I wanted to take a trip to see my friends . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
Since they lived far away I decided to fly in an airplane to go see them . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I went to an online website for the airline to book my flight . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I chose a window seat so I could enjoy the scenery on the flight . 	1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
After booking my flight I packed my suitcase with what I would need for my flight that left tomorrow . 	0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
The very next day I woke up and got dressed . 	0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
I wore loose fitting clothes that would be comfortable on the flights . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I wore shoes that I could take off easily to get through security and a belt with no metal in it , again so I could get through security easier . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
I went to the airport with my suitcase and went to the ticket counter . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
I gave them my ID card and they printed my ticket for me . 	1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
I gave them my suitcase and they tagged it for me and gave me a baggage claim ticket . 	1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I then went through security . 	1 0 0 0 1 0
After making it through secutity I went to my gate and waited until I was told it was time to board the plane . 	0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
I got on the plane in my window seat . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0
I listed to the stewardess as she showed me how to buckle my seatbelt and the planes safety features . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
Before I kew it we took off , and I was flying in a plane and enjoying the scenery below . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
It is time for me to get my haircut . 	1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0
I call my hairdresser and make an appointment . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
She says she can see me today at 3:00 pm . 	1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0
I leave the house at 2:30 in order to get there in time . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
When I arrive I check in and sit down in the waiting area . 	0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
My hairdresser calls me back . 	1 1 0 1 0 0
She first takes me to the shampoo bowl to wash my hair . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
I sit down and she puts a plastic cape around my neck to protect my clothes . 	1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
She leans the seat back and places my head over the shampoo bowl . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
She wets my hair and then lathers it with soap . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
Then she rinses the soap out and puts in conditioner . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0
She rinses the conditioner out and then wraps a towel around my head . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
She leans my seat back up and dries my hair with the towel . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
She then leads me to her barber chair to sit . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
She combs my hair and begins cutting . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
She cuts the top , sides and back . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
I keep my head very still while she does this . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0
After she is through cutting my hair she dries it with a blow-dryer . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
The she removes the plastic cape from around my neck and uses a soft brush to brush any look hair from my neck and face . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
Next we go to the cash register and I pay her for my haircut plus a tip . 	0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
I got my Yeti 575 enduro bike out and had made some minor adjustments to the tuning . 	1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
One other adjustment I made was to put some road tires on it so I could ride Capital Circle road of Tallahassee south to the major bike trail . 	0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0
As I made my way through traffic in the bike lane the wind blew on my face and the sun warmed my skin . 	0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
I was in a great mood . 	1 0 0 0 0 1 0
Then all of a sudden the mood was dampened and corrupted by that horrible noise of leaking air . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
I had hit some road debree that caused a flat tire . 	1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
After cursing the event and going through a small tantrum I consulted the tools of my backpack which I always brought with me . 	0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
I took the tire off , removed the tube , isolated the puncture , and then applied the patch . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
I reassembled the tube and tire , pumped it up with my small hand pump , and made my way back home . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I noticed it was getting warmer out and it would be a nice time to exercise so I took my bicycle out to see if it needed any maintenance . 	1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
At first everything looked good and I was ready to ride but then I noticed that the front tire was a little flat . 	0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
I had some tools in my garage so I picked up the bike and placed it on my workbench . 	1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
First I removed the wheel and checked as best I could to make sure there were no tears or other types of damage . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0
There was just a very small tear so I got out the patching kit that I 'd purchased from the sports store last summer . 	0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
I cleaned the area around the tear and applied the patch . 	1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
After waiting for a while , I put the tire back on my bike and re-inflated the tire . 	0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
The patch held and I was able to go for a bike ride that day . 	0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0
